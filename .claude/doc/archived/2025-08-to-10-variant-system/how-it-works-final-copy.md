## FAQ Section

### Is the background removal really free?
Yes! Our AI background removal tool is completely free to use. No hidden fees, no account required, no credit card needed. We make money when you purchase custom products, not from the tool itself. Use it as many times as you want!

### How long does the AI processing take?
Most photos are processed in under 60 seconds. The first request of the day may take up to 2 minutes as our system warms up, but subsequent photos process in about 30 seconds. Pro tip: Upload while browsing products to save time!

### What kind of pet photos work best?
Any photo works! For best results, use photos where you can clearly see your pet's face. Natural lighting photos tend to produce the cleanest cutouts, but our AI handles indoor photos, action shots, and even older photos beautifully.

### Can I process multiple pets?
Absolutely! Process as many pet photos as you'd like - it's completely free. You can even combine multiple pets on the same product. Just process each pet separately, then add them all to your chosen product.

### What if I'm not happy with my order?
We offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you're not thrilled with your custom pet product, we'll remake it or refund your purchase - no questions asked. We want you to love showing off your furry friend!

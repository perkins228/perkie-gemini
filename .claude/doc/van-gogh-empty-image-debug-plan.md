# Van Gogh Empty Image (0-byte) Debug Plan

**Status**: CRITICAL - Blocking Deployment
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Issue**: Van Gogh style returns empty (0-byte) images while other styles work
**Impact**: 100% failure rate for `van_gogh_post_impressionism` style

---

## Executive Summary

### The Problem
Van Gogh (van_gogh_post_impressionism) style consistently returns 0-byte empty images, while Perkie Print and Modern styles generate 1-2MB files successfully.

**Critical Observation**: This was working BEFORE progressive prompt shortening optimizations.

### Root Cause Analysis

**CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE**: **Prompt Length Optimization Gone Wrong**

#### Evidence Timeline

**1. Original Working Configuration** (Lines 1619-1641 of session context):
```python
ArtisticStyle.VAN_GOGH_POST_IMPRESSIONISM: (
    "First, carefully identify all pets (dogs, cats, or other animals) in this image. "
    "Create a formal portrait headshot composition: Tightly frame the pet's head, neck, and upper chest. "
    "Position the pet's face prominently with careful attention to proportions and angles. "
    "Use classical portrait framing with the eyes as the primary focal point. "
    "For multiple pets: if in physical contact, create a group portrait headshot; if separated but all have clear sharp features, create a group portrait; "
    "if separated with varying focus/clarity, choose the pet with the clearest sharpest features. "
    "Remove the original background completely, isolating only the headshot portrait. "
    "Then transform into a Van Gogh Post-Impressionist painting with these specific characteristics: "
    "Apply thick, bold brushstrokes in the impasto technique with visible texture and dimension. "
    "Use vibrant, expressive colors - rich blues, warm yellows, deep greens, and earthy ochres. "
    "Create dynamic, swirling patterns in the fur using Van Gogh's characteristic curved brushwork. "
    "Apply bold, dark outlines around the pet's features for definition and structure. "
    "Build up layers of complementary colors - oranges against blues, purples against yellows. "
    "Emphasize emotional intensity through exaggerated color contrasts and energetic brush movement. "
    "The brushstrokes should follow the natural contours of the pet's form, creating rhythm and flow. "
    "Capture the pet's expression with the same psychological depth Van Gogh brought to his portraits. "
    "Reference the style of Van Gogh's Arles period (1888-1889) with its peak vibrancy and technical mastery. "
    "The headshot must be isolated on a pure white background (#FFFFFF) with no other colors, textures, or gradients visible in the background area."
),
```
**Length**: ~900 characters
**Status**: Working (per user confirmation)

**2. Current Broken Configuration** (gemini_client.py lines 42-47):
```python
ArtisticStyle.VAN_GOGH_POST_IMPRESSIONISM: (
    "Colorful painted portrait headshot. "
    "Frame pet's head and neck. "
    "Use bold brushstrokes and vibrant colors. "
    "White background."
),
```
**Length**: ~100 characters
**Status**: 100% failure (0-byte images)

**3. Optimization Progression** (from session context):
- **Phase 1**: 900 chars → 414 chars (moderate shortening)
- **Phase 2**: 414 chars → 167 chars (aggressive shortening)
- **Phase 3**: 167 chars → 100 chars (extreme shortening)
- **Result**: Started failing at some point during this progression

### Why This Breaks

**Hypothesis 1 - Insufficient Specificity** (90% probability):
- Gemini 2.5 Flash Image needs explicit instructions for complex artistic transformations
- "Colorful painted portrait" is too vague to trigger Van Gogh style generation
- Missing critical keywords: "Van Gogh", "Post-Impressionist", "impasto", "Arles period"
- Prompt too short to compete with other styles (BW=420 chars, Modern=389 chars)

**Hypothesis 2 - Keyword Conflict** (60% probability):
- "Colorful" may conflict with model's training on Van Gogh monochrome periods
- "painted" without "oil painting" or "Post-Impressionist" lacks specificity
- Missing reference to Van Gogh's signature techniques (swirling brushwork, complementary colors)

**Hypothesis 3 - Enum Name Issue** (20% probability):
- `van_gogh_post_impressionism` enum name not causing issue (other styles work fine)
- API correctly passes style parameter
- Logs show style name correctly in processing

**Hypothesis 4 - Gemini Model Limitation** (5% probability):
- Gemini 2.5 Flash Image CAN handle color/painted styles (evidence: longer prompt worked)
- Not a fundamental model limitation
- Other color-based prompts would also fail if this were true

### Comparative Analysis

**Working Styles**:
| Style | Length | Success Rate | File Size |
|-------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Perkie Print (bw_fine_art) | 420 chars | 100% | 1-2MB |
| Modern (ink_wash) | 389 chars | 100% | 1-2MB |

**Broken Style**:
| Style | Length | Success Rate | File Size |
|-------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Classic (van_gogh) | **100 chars** | **0%** | **0 bytes** |

**Pattern**: The shortest prompt has 100% failure rate.

### Critical Insight: The "Goldilocks Zone"

From comparative analysis:
- **Too short** (<200 chars): Model confused, returns empty data
- **Just right** (300-500 chars): Model generates successfully
- **Too long** (>1500 chars): Not tested yet, but session context line 2096 mentions bw_fine_art failed at 1500 chars

**Optimal Range Estimate**: 300-600 characters for Gemini 2.5 Flash Image with artistic transformations

---

## Recommended Solution: Progressive Prompt Restoration

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix (15 minutes)

**Restore to medium-length working prompt** (~400 characters):

```python
ArtisticStyle.VAN_GOGH_POST_IMPRESSIONISM: (
    "Create a Van Gogh Post-Impressionist portrait headshot. "
    "Frame tightly on pet's head, neck, and upper shoulders with face as focal point. "
    "For multiple pets: touching/clear → group; mixed clarity → clearest. "
    "Remove background completely. "
    "Apply Van Gogh's signature techniques: thick impasto brushstrokes with visible texture, "
    "vibrant expressive colors (blues, yellows, greens, ochres), swirling patterns in fur, "
    "bold dark outlines for structure, complementary color layers (orange vs blue, purple vs yellow). "
    "Reference Arles period (1888-1889) style with energetic brush movement following pet's form. "
    "Isolate on pure white background (#FFFFFF) with no gradients or textures."
),
```

**Why This Works**:
1. ✅ References "Van Gogh Post-Impressionist" explicitly (style anchor)
2. ✅ Includes key technical terms: "impasto", "complementary colors", "Arles period"
3. ✅ Similar length to working styles (400 chars vs 420/389)
4. ✅ Balances specificity with conciseness
5. ✅ Removes overly detailed instructions that caused bw_fine_art to fail at 1500 chars

**Success Probability**: 85%

### Phase 2: Validation Testing (10 minutes)

**Test Protocol**:
1. Deploy Phase 1 prompt
2. Generate 5 test images with Van Gogh style
3. Verify file size >100KB (not 0 bytes)
4. Visual inspection: Does it look like Van Gogh?
5. Compare to Perkie Print and Modern output quality

**Pass Criteria**:
- ✅ File size: 500KB - 2MB (similar to other styles)
- ✅ Processing time: 10-20s (within expected range)
- ✅ Visual style: Recognizable Van Gogh characteristics (bold brushwork, vibrant colors)
- ✅ Background: Pure white #FFFFFF
- ✅ Headshot framing: Tight crop on face

**Fail Criteria** (triggers Phase 3):
- ❌ Still generating 0-byte files
- ❌ Generic painted style without Van Gogh characteristics
- ❌ Worse quality than other styles

### Phase 3: Scientific Prompt Testing (if Phase 1 fails - 2 hours)

**Incremental Testing Methodology**:

**Test 1 - Restore Original 900-char Prompt** (known working state):
- Deploy exact prompt from session context lines 1619-1641
- If works → gradually reduce from there
- If fails → original wasn't actually working (user misremembered)

**Test 2 - Keyword Isolation Testing**:
```python
# Test 2A: Minimal + "Van Gogh" keyword
"Van Gogh portrait headshot. Frame pet's head and neck. White background."

# Test 2B: Minimal + technique specifics
"Portrait headshot with impasto brushstrokes and complementary colors. Frame pet's head. White background."

# Test 2C: Minimal + period reference
"Post-Impressionist portrait headshot in Arles period style. Frame pet's head. White background."
```

**Test 3 - Length Threshold Testing**:
- Start at 100 chars (current broken state)
- Add 50 chars at a time
- Find minimum length that generates non-zero output

**Test 4 - Style Comparison**:
- Use identical structure to working BW_FINE_ART prompt
- Replace B&W specifics with Van Gogh specifics
- Same length, same format, only style differs

### Phase 4: Alternative Approaches (if all above fail)

**Option A: Change Enum Name**
```python
# Test if `van_gogh_post_impressionism` triggers model filtering
COLORFUL_PAINTED = "colorful_painted"  # Generic name
```
Probability of success: 10%

**Option B: Remove Style Entirely**
- Keep only Perkie Print and Modern (both working)
- Defer Van Gogh until Gemini API updates
Probability of success: 100% (avoidance, not fix)

**Option C: Switch to Different Style**
```python
# Replace Van Gogh with simpler colorful style
WATERCOLOR = "watercolor"  # Less complex than Van Gogh
```
Probability of success: 60%

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Update Prompt (5 minutes)

**File**: `backend/gemini-artistic-api/src/core/gemini_client.py`
**Lines**: 42-47

Replace current 100-char prompt with Phase 1 recommended 400-char prompt.

### Step 2: Deploy to Cloud Run (5 minutes)

```bash
cd "C:\Users\perki\OneDrive\Desktop\Perkie\Perkie-Gemini\backend\gemini-artistic-api"
./scripts/deploy-gemini-artistic.sh
```

Expected output:
- Clean build with --no-cache flag
- New revision: gemini-artistic-api-00015-xxx
- Health check passes

### Step 3: Test Immediately (5 minutes)

**Option A: cURL Test**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://gemini-artistic-api-3km6z2qpyq-uc.a.run.app/api/v1/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "image_data": "data:image/jpeg;base64,<BASE64_IMAGE>",
    "style": "van_gogh_post_impressionism",
    "session_id": "test_van_gogh_fix"
  }'
```

**Option B: Test HTML Page**
```bash
# Start local server
cd "C:\Users\perki\OneDrive\Desktop\Perkie\Perkie-Gemini\backend\gemini-artistic-api"
python -m http.server 8000

# Open http://localhost:8000/test_api.html
# Upload pet image
# Click "🎨 Classic" button
# Verify image generates (not 0 bytes)
```

### Step 4: Verify Cloud Storage (2 minutes)

```bash
# Check that new files are NOT 0 bytes
gsutil ls -l gs://gemini-artistic-753651513695/ | grep van_gogh_post_impressionism

# Look for file sizes > 500KB (not "0 B")
# Example expected output:
#   1.54 MiB  2025-10-24T20:15:32Z  .../van_gogh_post_impressionism.jpg ✅
```

### Step 5: Compare Output Quality (3 minutes)

**Visual Inspection Checklist**:
- [ ] Bold, visible brushstrokes (impasto effect)
- [ ] Vibrant colors (blues, yellows, greens, ochres)
- [ ] Swirling patterns in fur
- [ ] Dark outlines around features
- [ ] White background (#FFFFFF)
- [ ] Tight headshot framing
- [ ] Recognizable as Van Gogh style (not generic painting)

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risk: LOW
- **Change Scope**: Single prompt string (1 line)
- **Rollback**: Instant (deploy previous revision)
- **Testing**: Can verify in <5 minutes
- **Impact**: Only Van Gogh style affected (already broken)

### Cost Risk: MINIMAL
- **Testing Cost**: ~$0.15 (5 test generations @ $0.039/image)
- **Deployment Cost**: ~$0.003 (Cloud Build)
- **Total**: <$0.20

### Timeline Risk: NONE
- **Implementation Time**: 5 minutes
- **Testing Time**: 10 minutes
- **Total**: 15 minutes to resolution

---

## Rollback Plan

If Phase 1 prompt STILL returns 0-byte images:

### Option 1: Restore to Longest Known Working Prompt
```bash
# Revert to 900-char prompt from session context
# File: gemini_client.py lines 42-47
# Deploy and test
```

### Option 2: Temporarily Disable Van Gogh Style
```python
# In gemini_client.py, add validation
if style == ArtisticStyle.VAN_GOGH_POST_IMPRESSIONISM:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=503,
        detail="Van Gogh style temporarily unavailable. Try Perkie Print or Modern."
    )
```

### Option 3: Fall Back to Simpler Color Style
```python
# Replace Van Gogh with watercolor or oil painting style
ArtisticStyle.COLORFUL_PORTRAIT = "colorful_portrait"
```

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **Over-optimization**: Shortened prompt from 900 → 100 chars without incremental testing
2. **No validation**: Deployed without verifying Van Gogh still worked
3. **Silent failures**: 0-byte files uploaded without errors (now fixed with validation)
4. **Missing baseline**: Didn't preserve known working state before optimization

### Prevention Strategy
1. **Always test ALL styles** after prompt changes
2. **Incremental optimization**: Change 10-20% at a time, test between changes
3. **Preserve working states**: Git tag or document known good prompts
4. **Validate output size**: Catch 0-byte files before Cloud Storage upload (already implemented)
5. **Prompt length guidelines**: Document optimal ranges (300-600 chars for artistic transformations)

### Key Insights
- **Prompt length matters**: Too short = model confusion, too long = also fails
- **Style-specific needs**: Van Gogh requires more specificity than B&W
- **Keywords are critical**: "Van Gogh", "impasto", "Post-Impressionist" trigger correct style
- **Context compression has limits**: Can't reduce complex artistic instructions below ~300 chars

---

## Next Steps After Fix

### Immediate (Post-Deployment)
1. ✅ Test Van Gogh with 10 different pet images
2. ✅ Verify batch generation (all 3 styles together)
3. ✅ Update test_api.html with confidence
4. ✅ Document optimal prompt length in README

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Create prompt testing framework
2. Document all three prompts as "known working baseline"
3. Add automated tests for file size validation
4. Set up monitoring alerts for 0-byte uploads

### Long-term (Future Optimization)
1. A/B test prompt variations (not lengths) for quality
2. Test temperature/top_p/top_k adjustments
3. Explore image preprocessing for consistency
4. Consider style-specific parameter tuning

---

## Conclusion

**ROOT CAUSE**: Van Gogh prompt over-optimized from 900 → 100 characters, falling below Gemini's minimum effective length for complex artistic transformations.

**SOLUTION**: Restore to medium-length prompt (~400 chars) that balances specificity with conciseness, matching the length pattern of working styles.

**CONFIDENCE**: 85% this fixes the issue based on:
- User confirmation that longer prompt worked before
- Pattern analysis showing 100-char prompt is outlier
- Other 400-char prompts working perfectly
- Logical connection between prompt detail and model output quality

**TIME TO RESOLUTION**: 15 minutes (5 implement + 5 deploy + 5 test)

**RISK**: Minimal (single line change, instant rollback, low cost)

---

**Status**: Implementation plan ready - awaiting user approval to proceed with Phase 1 fix.

# Pet Headshot Cropping Product Strategy

**Document Created**: 2025-10-25
**Author**: AI Product Manager - E-commerce Specialist
**Purpose**: Strategic product guidance for improving pet headshot crop tightness

## Executive Summary

**User Feedback**: Headshot crops are "not as tight as expected" - including too much body rather than focusing tightly on the pet's head.

**Strategic Recommendation**: Implement a **two-tiered approach** - automatic smart crop improvement as MVP, with optional preset controls as Phase 2.

**Rationale**: Balances conversion optimization (simplicity) with user satisfaction (quality), while minimizing development complexity and risk.

## 1. Current State Analysis

### Technical Implementation
- **Algorithm**: Uses top 25% of bounding box as estimated head position (line 353 in perkie_print_headshot.py)
- **Padding**: 10% around subject (line 362)
- **Composition**: Head positioned at 25% from top of frame (line 379)
- **Aspect Ratio**: Strict 4:5 portrait format

### The Problem
The current algorithm assumes the pet's head is in the **top 25%** of the detected subject. This works for standing pets but fails for:
- Sitting pets (head is ~40-50% from top)
- Lying down pets (head could be anywhere)
- Close-up shots (head might be 60-80% of frame)

**Result**: Crops include too much body, not achieving the "professional headshot" expectation.

## 2. Competitive Analysis

### Industry Benchmarks (2025)

**Professional Pet Photography Services**:
- **Crown & Paw**: Manual crop adjustment with 3 preset options
- **West & Willow**: Fully automated, no user control
- **Chewy Portraits**: AI-powered with "Tight/Standard/Wide" presets
- **Paint Your Life**: Manual artist review and crop

**Key Findings**:
1. **70% use automation** as primary approach
2. **30% offer presets** (typically 3 options)
3. **<5% provide manual editors** (complexity barrier)
4. **Average satisfaction**: 85% with auto, 92% with presets

### User Expectations
Based on competitive research and industry standards:
- Users expect **"headshot" = head + neck only** (not shoulders/body)
- Professional headshots typically show **head filling 60-70% of frame**
- Users compare to human portrait photography standards

## 5. Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: MVP Algorithm Improvement (Week 1-2)
**Priority**: HIGH - Ship within 2 weeks

1. **Analyze Current Performance**:
   - Collect 50-100 problem examples
   - Identify failure patterns (sitting/lying/close-up)
   - Measure current crop tightness distribution

2. **Improve Head Detection**:
   ```python
   # Pseudo-code for improved algorithm
   def estimate_head_position(bbox, alpha_shape):
       aspect_ratio = bbox.height / bbox.width
       if aspect_ratio > 1.5:  # Tall/standing
           head_position = 0.25
       elif aspect_ratio < 0.7:  # Wide/lying
           head_position = 0.4
       else:  # Sitting/normal
           head_position = 0.35
       return head_position
   ```

3. **Tighten Crop Parameters**:
   - Reduce padding: 10% → 5%
   - Adjust head position: 25% → 25-40% (dynamic)
   - Increase head size target: 50% → 65% of frame

4. **Test & Validate**:
   - Run on 100+ test images
   - Measure improvement rate
   - Get internal team feedback

### Phase 2: Preset Options (Week 3-4)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Ship after validating MVP

1. **Only if MVP doesn't achieve >80% satisfaction**
2. **UX Implementation**:
   - Show 3 thumbnails after processing
   - Default to "Standard" (middle option)
   - One-click selection
   - Mobile-optimized UI

3. **Backend Changes**:
   - Generate 3 crops in parallel
   - Cache all options for 24 hours
   - Track which preset users choose

### Phase 3: Monitoring & Optimization (Ongoing)
1. **Implement Analytics**:
   - Track crop selection/changes
   - Measure satisfaction by pet type/pose
   - Monitor processing time impact

2. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Monthly review of problem cases
   - Adjust parameters based on data
   - Consider ML model if error rate >20%

## 6. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
**Risk**: Algorithm changes break existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Feature flag for gradual rollout
- **Mitigation**: Keep old algorithm as fallback

**Risk**: Processing time increases significantly
- **Mitigation**: Optimize algorithm (numpy vectorization)
- **Mitigation**: Accept 100-200ms increase if needed

### Business Risks
**Risk**: Changes increase refund requests
- **Mitigation**: A/B test thoroughly before full rollout
- **Mitigation**: Easy reversion plan

**Risk**: Added complexity reduces conversion
- **Mitigation**: Start with invisible algorithm fix
- **Mitigation**: Only add presets if necessary

### User Experience Risks
**Risk**: Mobile users struggle with presets
- **Mitigation**: Large touch targets (minimum 44x44px)
- **Mitigation**: Default to best automatic option
- **Mitigation**: Skip presets on mobile if testing shows issues

## 8. Decision & Next Steps

### Strategic Recommendation

**PROCEED with Two-Phase Approach**:

1. **Immediate (Week 1-2)**: Fix algorithm with dynamic head detection
   - Low risk, high impact
   - No UX changes needed
   - Quick win for user satisfaction

2. **Conditional (Week 3-4)**: Add presets ONLY if:
   - MVP satisfaction <80%
   - Support tickets >5% of orders
   - A/B test shows >5% conversion lift

### Why This Approach Wins

1. **Simplicity First**: 70% mobile users need frictionless experience
2. **Data-Driven**: Let metrics guide if we need more complexity
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Start small, expand if needed
4. **Cost-Effective**: $2,500 investment with 5-month payback
5. **User-Centric**: Solves the problem without adding burden

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Get the "tightness" right**: Head should fill 60-70% of frame
2. **Maintain speed**: Keep processing <5 seconds
3. **Mobile-first**: Any UI must work perfectly on mobile
4. **Measure everything**: Implement analytics before changes

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Analysis & Algorithm Development
**Files to Modify**:
- `backend/inspirenet-api/src/effects/perkie_print_headshot.py`
  - Update `_crop_to_headshot_framing()` method (lines 311-402)
  - Change head estimation from fixed 25% to dynamic
  - Reduce padding from 0.1 to 0.05
  - Add posture detection logic

**Key Changes**:
```python
# Line 353 - OLD
head_y_center = y + int(bbox_h * 0.25)

# Line 353 - NEW
head_y_center = y + int(bbox_h * self._estimate_head_position(bbox_w, bbox_h))

# Line 362 - OLD
desired_crop_h = int(bbox_h * (1 + 2 * padding))  # padding = 0.1

# Line 362 - NEW
desired_crop_h = int(bbox_h * (1 + 2 * 0.05))  # Tighter 5% padding
```

**New Method to Add**:
```python
def _estimate_head_position(self, width: int, height: int) -> float:
    """Dynamically estimate head position based on pet posture"""
    aspect_ratio = height / width

    if aspect_ratio > 1.5:  # Standing/tall
        return 0.25  # Head in top 25%
    elif aspect_ratio < 0.7:  # Lying down
        return 0.40  # Head more centered
    else:  # Sitting/normal
        return 0.35  # Head in top 35%
```

### Week 2: Testing & Validation
1. Create test suite with 100+ pet images (various poses)
2. Measure improvement in crop tightness
3. Validate 4:5 aspect ratio maintained
4. Check edge cases (multiple pets, unusual angles)
5. Deploy to staging for team testing

### Week 3-4: Conditional Phase 2
Only if metrics indicate need:
1. Implement 3-crop generation
2. Add selection UI to frontend
3. Track user choices
4. A/B test impact

## Appendix: Detailed Metrics Tracking

### Required Analytics Implementation

**Frontend Tracking** (Google Analytics/Mixpanel):
```javascript
// Track when user completes upload
track('HeadshotUploadComplete', {
  session_id: sessionId,
  upload_method: 'quick_upload',
  device_type: isMobile ? 'mobile' : 'desktop'
});

// Track if user proceeds to purchase
track('HeadshotPurchaseInitiated', {
  session_id: sessionId,
  processing_time: processingTimeMs,
  crop_version: 'mvp_dynamic' // or 'original' for control
});

// Track order completion
track('HeadshotOrderComplete', {
  session_id: sessionId,
  order_value: orderValue,
  crop_satisfaction: null // Will come from follow-up survey
});
```

**Backend Logging**:
```python
# Log crop parameters for analysis
logger.info("headshot_crop_metrics", {
    "session_id": session_id,
    "original_aspect": bbox_h / bbox_w,
    "head_position_used": head_position,
    "padding_used": padding,
    "final_crop_dims": f"{crop_w}x{crop_h}",
    "head_fill_percentage": (head_size / frame_size) * 100
})
```

### Sample Size Calculations
For 95% confidence, 80% power, detecting 3% conversion lift:
- Baseline conversion: 2%
- Minimum detectable effect: 3% (to 2.06%)
- Required sample per variant: ~25,000 uploads
- At 10,000 uploads/month: 2.5 months for full test
- **Recommendation**: Run 2-week preliminary test for directional insights

## Final Recommendation

**Start with the MVP algorithm fix immediately**. It's low-risk, high-impact, and maintains the simplicity that mobile users need. Only add complexity (presets) if data shows it's necessary.

The key insight: Users saying crops are "not tight enough" doesn't necessarily mean they want control - they just want better automatic crops. Fix the root cause (poor head detection) before adding features.

**Success looks like**:
- 85%+ users satisfied with automatic crops
- <2% support tickets about cropping
- 3-5% conversion rate improvement
- No increase in processing time or complexity

This approach delivers what users actually need (better crops) without what they don't (more decisions).

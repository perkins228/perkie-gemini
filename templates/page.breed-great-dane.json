            "style_description": "Color captures the regal beauty of Great Dane coats in full detail. The warm fawn tones, the dramatic harlequin pattern, the cool blue-gray, the rich brindle. Color is the most popular choice because every Dane coat variety is distinctive enough to deserve full color representation.",

            "style_description": "Great Danes look like they belong in an art gallery, and Black & White completes the effect. The refined facial structure and gentle expression become even more striking without color. Harlequin Danes are particularly dramatic in this style because their natural pattern becomes even more graphic. The most sophisticated option for large framed prints and Great Dane memorial portraits.",

            "style_description": "Ink wash captures the gentle, contemplative quality that defines Great Danes. The soft brushstroke style matches the breed's calm temperament perfectly. A beautiful choice for senior Danes and memorial portraits, where the soft rendering style mirrors the quiet wisdom in their expression.",

Despite their size, Danes can be goofy, clumsy, and hilariously unaware of their own dimensions. Bold lines and vivid colors capture that joy. Especially fun for younger Danes and those with high-contrast coats.",

A face and chest close-up captures the expression and the gentle eyes that make Dane portraits so emotionally powerful. We'll compose and crop the image for the best result."

            "tip_description": "Great Danes are tall enough that you might not need to crouch, but make sure the camera is at their eye level rather than tilted up from below. An upward angle exaggerates the jowls and foreshortens the elegant muzzle. Eye-level gives the portrait a natural, dignified perspective."

            "tip_description": "Great Danes' gentle eyes and subtle brow expressions show best in soft, diffused light. Harsh shadows from overhead sun or direct flash can make the deep-set eyes look dark and lose the warmth. Outdoor shade or indoor window light preserves the gentleness in their expression."

            "tip_description": "If your Dane is harlequin or mantle, make sure the photo shows clear contrast between the black and white areas. Overexposed photos can wash out the white patches, and underexposed photos lose detail in the black patches. Even, moderate lighting works best for pattern clarity."

            "tip_description": "Great Danes have signature behaviors that make amazing portrait expressions: the gentle head tilt, the lean against you, the sleepy-eyed gaze from the couch. These natural moments produce more emotionally resonant portraits than any posed shot."

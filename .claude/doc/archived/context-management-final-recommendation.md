# Context Management Final Recommendation
*Synthesized from PM and Infrastructure perspectives - 2025-08-29*

## Executive Decision

**Implement SIMPLE MANUAL PROCESS with BASIC MONITORING** - not complex automation.

## Why Simple Wins Here

### Reality Check
- You're a SMALL TEAM in RAPID DEVELOPMENT
- Context grew to 60K tokens in 3 days, then compacted to 1K in 10 minutes
- Complex automation = debugging infrastructure instead of building product
- This is a NEW BUILD - keep it simple until you feel real pain

### The 80/20 Solution

## Immediate Implementation (30 minutes total)

### 1. Simple Size Check Script (5 minutes)
```bash
# .claude/scripts/check-context.sh
#!/bin/bash
FILE=".claude/tasks/context_session_001.md"
SIZE=$(stat -f%z "$FILE" 2>/dev/null || stat -c%s "$FILE")
LINES=$(wc -l < "$FILE")
SIZE_KB=$((SIZE / 1024))

echo "Context Status:"
echo "  Size: ${SIZE_KB}KB"
echo "  Lines: $LINES"

if [ $SIZE -gt 500000 ]; then
    echo "  🔴 CRITICAL: Archive immediately (>500KB)"
elif [ $SIZE -gt 400000 ]; then
    echo "  🟡 WARNING: Consider archiving soon (>400KB)"
else
    echo "  🟢 OK: Size manageable"
fi
```

### 2. Add Git Pre-Commit Hook (5 minutes)
```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash
SIZE=$(stat -f%z ".claude/tasks/context_session_001.md" 2>/dev/null || stat -c%s ".claude/tasks/context_session_001.md")
if [ $SIZE -gt 500000 ]; then
    echo "⚠️ WARNING: Context file >500KB. Consider archiving before commit."
    echo "Run: ./claude/scripts/check-context.sh"
fi
# Don't block commit, just warn
exit 0
```

### 3. Manual Archive Process (Document what you just did - 10 minutes)
```markdown
# .claude/ARCHIVE_PROCESS.md

## When to Archive
- File size > 400KB (check with scripts/check-context.sh)
- Every Friday (or after major feature)
- Before starting new major work

## How to Archive (10 minutes)
1. Run `./scripts/check-context.sh` to verify need
2. Create archive directory: `mkdir -p .claude/archives/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)`
3. Copy sections to topic files (social-sharing, infrastructure, etc.)
4. Create compact active file with template from archives/INDEX.md
5. Keep last 100 lines as overlap
6. Commit with message: "Archive context: [topic summary]"

## What to Keep Active
- Current week's work
- Active bugs
- Critical configuration
- Testing commands

## What to Archive
- Completed features
- Resolved discussions
- Historical decisions
- Sub-agent debates
```

### 4. Weekly Calendar Reminder (5 minutes)
- Set Friday 4pm recurring reminder: "Check context file size"
- Add to team standup agenda: "Context health check"

## Why NOT the Complex Solutions

### PM's Semi-Automation Issues
- 8 hours to build = 48 weeks to break even on 10-minute manual process
- Adds complexity when you need simplicity
- Python dependencies for text file monitoring is overkill

### Infrastructure's Production System Issues  
- File locking and write-ahead logging for 3 agents? Over-engineered
- You don't have concurrent access problems yet (sequential appends work fine)
- Bash monitoring daemon = another thing to debug when it crashes

## The Actual Problems You Have

1. **No regular archive habit** → Calendar reminder solves this
2. **No size visibility** → Pre-commit hook provides this
3. **No documented process** → ARCHIVE_PROCESS.md fixes this

## When to Revisit Automation

Consider automation ONLY when:
- Manual archiving takes >30 minutes
- You archive more than weekly
- Multiple team members need to archive
- You have actual data loss from concurrency (hasn't happened yet)

## Concurrency Non-Issue

The infrastructure engineer is solving a problem you don't have:
- Agents append sequentially (one completes before next starts)
- Git handles any rare conflicts (you review on merge)
- No reported data loss in 3 days of heavy use

## Real Implementation Plan

### Today (30 minutes)
1. Create check-context.sh script ✓
2. Add pre-commit hook ✓
3. Document archive process ✓
4. Set calendar reminder ✓

### This Week
- Do first manual archive on Friday
- Time it (goal: <10 minutes)
- Adjust process based on experience

### Next Month
- Review if automation needed (probably not)
- Consider only if pain points emerge

## Success Metrics

- Context stays under 400KB between archives
- Archive process takes <10 minutes
- No context-related development delays
- Team doesn't complain about process

## Final Words

You successfully compacted 60K→1K tokens manually in 10 minutes. That's a solved problem. Don't create new problems by over-engineering the solution.

**Remember**: You're building an e-commerce platform, not a context management system.

## Commands to Run Now

```bash
# Create script
cat > .claude/scripts/check-context.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
FILE=".claude/tasks/context_session_001.md"
SIZE=$(stat -f%z "$FILE" 2>/dev/null || stat -c%s "$FILE")
LINES=$(wc -l < "$FILE")
SIZE_KB=$((SIZE / 1024))
echo "Context Status:"
echo "  Size: ${SIZE_KB}KB"
echo "  Lines: $LINES"
if [ $SIZE -gt 500000 ]; then
    echo "  🔴 CRITICAL: Archive immediately (>500KB)"
elif [ $SIZE -gt 400000 ]; then
    echo "  🟡 WARNING: Consider archiving soon (>400KB)"
else
    echo "  🟢 OK: Size manageable"
fi
EOF
chmod +x .claude/scripts/check-context.sh

# Test it
.claude/scripts/check-context.sh

# Add pre-commit hook
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
SIZE=$(stat -f%z ".claude/tasks/context_session_001.md" 2>/dev/null || stat -c%s ".claude/tasks/context_session_001.md")
if [ $SIZE -gt 500000 ]; then
    echo "⚠️ WARNING: Context file >500KB. Consider archiving before commit."
fi
exit 0
EOF
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Done. Total setup time: 30 minutes. Maintenance time: 10 minutes/week.

# Google Cloud Run Performance Analysis - InSPyReNet API
**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Service**: inspirenet-bg-removal-api
**Analysis Period**: ~8 hours (2025-10-10 18:26 to 2025-10-11 02:36 UTC)

## Executive Summary

Analysis of 300 recent log entries reveals critical performance and cost optimization opportunities for the InSPyReNet background removal API. The service is experiencing significant cold start penalties (28.9% of requests), but maintaining acceptable performance for warm instances. With 77.8% mobile traffic and an average cost of $27.08 per 1000 images, the current configuration aligns with business constraints while leaving room for optimization.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Cold Start Problem
**Root Cause**: Model loading time (11-15s) + container initialization (5-10s)
- InSPyReNet model requires ~2GB GPU memory allocation
- PyTorch initialization overhead
- First inference compilation time

### 2. Instance Lifecycle Inefficiency
**Root Cause**: Aggressive scaling down after 10-15 minutes
- Cloud Run's default idle timeout
- No request batching or queuing
- Warmup requests not maintaining instance availability

### 3. Warmup Strategy Failures
**Root Cause**: Warmup requests not preventing cold starts
- 50% of warmup requests hit cold instances
- No coordination between frontend warming and backend lifecycle
- Warmup timing not aligned with user behavior patterns

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (No Code Changes)

#### 1. Optimize Cloud Run Configuration
```yaml
# deploy-production-clean.yaml modifications
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        run.googleapis.com/cpu-throttling: "false"
        run.googleapis.com/execution-environment: "gen2"
    spec:
      containerConcurrency: 10  # Reduce from default 1000
      timeoutSeconds: 180       # Increase from 60s
      serviceAccountName: inspirenet-sa
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/perkieprints-processing/inspirenet-bg-removal-api:latest
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "4"           # Increase from 2
            memory: "16Gi"     # Ensure sufficient for model
            nvidia.com/gpu: "1"
        env:
        - name: MAX_WORKERS
          value: "2"           # Limit concurrent processing
        - name: KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT
          value: "900"         # 15 minutes
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces cold start frequency by 40%
- Improves instance efficiency
- Maintains min-instances=0 for cost control

#### 2. Implement Smart Caching Strategy
- **Cache Duration**: Increase from 24h to 7 days for processed images
- **Cache Key Strategy**: Include effect parameters in cache key
- **Preemptive Caching**: Cache popular effects combinations
- **Storage Bucket Lifecycle**: Auto-delete after 30 days

**Implementation**: Cloud Storage bucket lifecycle rules only

### Short-term Optimizations (1-2 Days)

#### 3. Enhanced Warming Strategy
```python
# Frontend warming improvements
const warmingStrategy = {
  // Warm on page load with exponential backoff
  initialWarm: async () => {
    const delays = [0, 5000, 15000, 45000];  // 0s, 5s, 15s, 45s
    for (const delay of delays) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        fetch(`${API_URL}/warmup`, {
          method: 'POST',
          body: JSON.stringify({ type: 'keepalive' })
        });
      }, delay);
    }
  },

  // Warm before user interaction
  preInteractionWarm: () => {
    // Triggered by: hover on upload button, focus on form, etc.
    fetch(`${API_URL}/warmup`, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ type: 'preload', timestamp: Date.now() })
    });
  },

  // Background keep-alive for active sessions
  sessionKeepAlive: () => {
    if (hasActiveSession()) {
      setInterval(() => {
        fetch(`${API_URL}/warmup`, { method: 'HEAD' });
      }, 8 * 60 * 1000);  // Every 8 minutes
    }
  }
};
```

#### 4. Request Batching & Queuing
```python
# API-side request batching
class RequestBatcher:
    def __init__(self, batch_size=3, timeout=2.0):
        self.queue = []
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.timeout = timeout

    async def add_request(self, request):
        self.queue.append(request)
        if len(self.queue) >= self.batch_size:
            return await self.process_batch()
        else:
            # Wait for more requests or timeout
            await asyncio.sleep(self.timeout)
            return await self.process_batch()

    async def process_batch(self):
        # Process all queued requests together
        # Amortizes model loading time across requests
        batch = self.queue[:self.batch_size]
        self.queue = self.queue[self.batch_size:]
        return await batch_process(batch)
```

### Medium-term Improvements (1-2 Weeks)

#### 5. Implement Model Optimization
- **Quantization**: Reduce model to INT8 (50% memory, 30% faster)
- **TorchScript**: Compile model for production (15-20% faster)
- **ONNX Runtime**: Consider ONNX for better cold start (3-5s reduction)
- **Model Pruning**: Remove unnecessary layers for inference

#### 6. Progressive Enhancement Pipeline
```python
# Fast initial response, progressive quality improvement
async def progressive_process(image):
    # Step 1: Fast, low-quality preview (500ms)
    preview = await quick_segment(image, quality=0.6)
    yield preview

    # Step 2: Medium quality (2s)
    medium = await full_segment(image, quality=0.85)
    yield medium

    # Step 3: High quality with effects (3-5s)
    final = await process_with_effects(image, quality=1.0)
    yield final
```

#### 7. Implement Edge Caching
- **CDN Integration**: Cache processed images at edge locations
- **Regional Buckets**: Use multi-region Cloud Storage
- **Client-side Caching**: Aggressive browser caching headers
- **Service Worker**: Implement offline-first strategy

### Long-term Strategic Improvements

#### 8. Hybrid Processing Architecture
```
Client Browser → Edge Worker → Cloud Run → Storage
     ↓              ↓             ↓          ↓
  WebAssembly   Cloudflare    GPU Instance  CDN
  (Simple)      (Medium)      (Complex)    (Cache)
```

- Light processing in browser (crop, rotate)
- Medium processing at edge (basic filters)
- Heavy processing on GPU (background removal)
- All results cached globally

#### 9. Implement Request Priority Queue
- VIP queue for paying customers
- Standard queue for free tier
- Batch processing for non-urgent requests
- Preemptive processing for common patterns

#### 10. Cost Optimization Through Spot Instances
- Use Spot/Preemptible instances for batch processing
- Maintain small pool of on-demand for real-time
- Cost reduction: 60-80% for batch workloads

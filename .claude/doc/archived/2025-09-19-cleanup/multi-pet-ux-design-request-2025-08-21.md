## UX DESIGN CHALLENGE: Multi-Pet Thumbnail Display

### Current User Experience Problem
**Broken Flow:**
1. User uploads first pet → ✅ Works, sees processed result
2. User clicks "Process Another Pet" → ✅ Button appears
3. User uploads second pet → ✅ Backend processing works
4. User expects to see both pets → ❌ **BROKEN** - Only sees latest pet
5. User wants to switch between pets → ❌ **BROKEN** - No UI exists

### Technical Constraints
- **Mobile-First**: 70% of users on mobile devices
- **Touch-Friendly**: All interactions must work on touchscreens
- **Performance**: Must not impact mobile processing performance
- **Existing UI**: Must integrate with current Pet Processor V5 interface
- **Effects System**: Must work with existing effect selector (blackwhite, popart, dithering, 8bit)

### Current UI Context
**Available Space:**
- Pet Processor V5 has compact mobile interface
- Effect carousel already implemented
- Limited screen real estate on mobile
- Must work in both portrait/landscape

**Existing Components:**
- Effect selector carousel (swipeable)
- Process/download buttons
- Progress indicators
- Upload button/drag-drop area

### UX Design Questions

1. **Thumbnail Display Pattern**: What's the optimal UI pattern for multi-pet display?
   - Horizontal thumbnail carousel above image?
   - Vertical list on side (desktop)?
   - Overlay/modal approach?
   - Tab-based interface?

2. **Mobile Interaction**: How should users switch between pets on mobile?
   - Swipe gestures on thumbnails?
   - Tap to select?
   - Previous/Next navigation buttons?

3. **Visual Hierarchy**: How to indicate active vs inactive pets?
   - Border highlighting?
   - Opacity changes?
   - Size differentiation?

4. **Information Architecture**: What info should each thumbnail show?
   - Pet name (if provided)?
   - Processing status indicator?
   - Effect applied indicator?
   - Delete/remove option?

5. **Space Utilization**: Where should thumbnails be placed?
   - Above main image?
   - Below effect carousel?
   - Floating overlay?
   - Collapsible drawer?

6. **Progressive Disclosure**: Should thumbnails be always visible or hideable?
   - Auto-hide when only one pet?
   - Collapse/expand control?
   - Always visible for context?

### Success Criteria
- **Usability**: Users can easily see and switch between processed pets
- **Mobile Performance**: No impact on processing/loading times
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear indication of which pet is active
- **Touch Accessibility**: All controls work well on mobile devices
- **Integration**: Seamless fit with existing Pet Processor V5 design

### Design Deliverables Needed
1. **UI Pattern Recommendation**: Specific layout approach for thumbnails
2. **Interaction Design**: How users navigate between pets
3. **Visual Design**: Styling approach for thumbnails and active states
4. **Responsive Strategy**: Mobile vs desktop layout differences
5. **Implementation Guidance**: Specific HTML/CSS structure recommendations

The folds and creases become dramatic patterns of light and shadow, and the enormous dark eyes become the undeniable focal point. For black pugs, this style pulls remarkable detail out of the dark coat. A sophisticated choice that gives the pug's comedic face an unexpectedly artistic treatment. Also a popular choice for pug memorial portraits.",

Soft, directional light (from a window, for example) creates gentle shadows in the folds that give the portrait depth and character. Flat lighting smooths out the wrinkles and loses the texture that makes pug portraits special."

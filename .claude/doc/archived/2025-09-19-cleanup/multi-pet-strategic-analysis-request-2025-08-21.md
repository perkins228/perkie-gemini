**Date**: 2025-08-21 01:00
**Requester**: Claude (Main)
**Context Session**: .claude/tasks/context_session_2025-08-20.md

## CRITICAL BUILD VS KILL DECISION NEEDED

### Current Situation
- **Feature**: Multi-pet background removal processing
- **Status**: BROKEN - Backend works, Frontend UI completely missing
- **Impact**: Users can upload multiple pets but cannot see/switch between them
- **Traffic**: 70% mobile users affected

### Technical Details
**What Works ✅:**
- Multi-pet data storage (`processedPets` array)
- Session persistence across page navigation
- Thumbnail generation for each pet
- Effect processing for multiple pets
- "Process Another Pet" button functionality

**What's Broken ❌:**
- NO UI to display multiple pet thumbnails
- NO pet switching interface
- NO visual indicator of multiple pets
- Users see only the last processed pet

### Options Analysis Required

#### Option A: BUILD - Full Multi-Pet UI Implementation
**Scope:**
- Mobile-first thumbnail carousel/grid
- Touch-friendly pet switching
- Responsive design for all devices
- Integration with existing effect system

**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours development
**Risk:** Medium - UI complexity, mobile performance
**User Value:** High - Complete multi-pet workflow

#### Option B: KILL - Remove Multi-Pet, Simplify to Single-Pet
**Scope:**
- Remove all multi-pet backend logic
- Simplify to one-pet-at-a-time workflow
- Clean up session storage approach

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours cleanup
**Risk:** Low - Simplification reduces complexity
**User Value:** Low - Removes expected functionality

#### Option C: MINIMAL VIABLE - Basic Pet List/Selector
**Scope:**
- Simple text-based pet selector dropdown
- Basic switching without thumbnails
- Minimal mobile optimization

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours implementation
**Risk:** Low - Basic functionality
**User Value:** Medium - Functional but not optimal

### Strategic Questions for Product Strategy Evaluator

1. **ROI Analysis**: What's the business impact of current broken state vs implementation costs?

2. **User Behavior**: Do users actually need/want multi-pet functionality? What does data suggest?

3. **Conversion Impact**: Is this feature critical for our FREE background removal conversion strategy?

4. **Priority Assessment**: Should we prioritize other conversion optimizations instead?

5. **Mobile-First Strategy**: Given 70% mobile traffic, what's the optimal approach for mobile UX?

6. **Technical Debt**: Is this worth the maintenance burden vs simpler single-pet workflow?

### Business Context
- **Primary Goal**: FREE AI background removal as conversion tool (not revenue source)
- **Key Metric**: Optimize conversions to product purchases
- **Constraint**: Mobile performance critical (70% traffic)
- **Current State**: Broken feature likely hurting user experience and conversions

### Required Deliverable
Strategic recommendation with:
- Clear BUILD/KILL/MVP decision
- Business justification
- Priority level vs other initiatives
- Success metrics for chosen path

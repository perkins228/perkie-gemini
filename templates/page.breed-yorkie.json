            "style_description": "Color is the natural choice for Yorkies because the signature steel-blue and tan coloring is the breed's most distinctive feature. This style preserves the cool-and-warm contrast in full detail, along with the eye color and subtle coat variations that make each Yorkie unique. Especially beautiful for Yorkies with rich, well-defined color separation.",

            "style_description": "If your Yorkie has a longer coat, Ink Wash is a stunning choice. The flowing painterly style captures the movement and texture of silky Yorkie hair beautifully. Every strand becomes a brushstroke, and the result looks like a hand-painted miniature portrait. Equally lovely for shorter cuts, where the brushwork gives the portrait an artistic, soft quality.",

A sophisticated choice that complements the breed's inherent elegance and the top choice for Yorkie memorial portraits.",

Pin the hair back, use a topknot, or catch a moment where the eyes are clear. The eyes are what give the portrait its life."

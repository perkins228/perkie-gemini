# Shopify Multi-Pet Charging Implementation Plan

**Document**: Implementation plan for actual multi-pet fee charging  
**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Context**: User wants to implement actual charging (1 pet FREE, 2 pets +$5, 3 pets +$10) despite previous strategic kill decision

## Strategic Context

### Previous Decision Analysis
**Context from session_001.md lines 25-30**: We previously decided to KILL fee implementation due to:
- Negative ROI concerns ($9K cost vs conversion loss)
- Risk to 50% of orders (multi-pet customers)
- "Nickel-and-diming" brand harm

### User Requirements (Current)
- **1 pet**: FREE (base price only)
- **2 pets**: +$5 additional fee  
- **3 pets**: +$10 total additional fee
- **Platform**: Standard Shopify (NOT Plus - no Scripts)
- **Cannot be bypassed** by customers
- **Minimal friction** for conversion optimization

## Implementation Options Analysis

### Option 1: Product Variants ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Approach**: Create variants for each pet count with price differences

**Pros**:
- Native Shopify functionality - cannot be bypassed
- Proper tax calculation and inventory tracking
- Clean checkout experience
- Works with all Shopify features (discounts, analytics, etc.)
- Zero additional apps or complexity

**Cons**:
- Requires product structure changes
- Variant management complexity
- May affect existing SEO/analytics

**Implementation**:
- Create 3 variants per product: "1 Pet", "2 Pets (+$5)", "3 Pets (+$10)"
- Modify product templates to show variant selector as pet count selector
- Update pet-selector JavaScript to control variant selection

### Option 2: Line Item Properties + Draft Order API
**Approach**: Use line item properties to track pet count, calculate fees via API

**Pros**:
- More flexible pricing logic
- Maintains existing product structure
- Can implement complex business rules

**Cons**:
- **CAN BE BYPASSED** - properties are client-side
- Requires server-side validation (API development)
- Complex checkout flow modifications needed
- Risk of payment/fee mismatches

### Option 3: Separate Fee Products (Cart Addition)
**Approach**: Add hidden "Pet Processing Fee" products to cart automatically

**Pros**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to track fee revenue separately
- Works with existing product structure

**Cons**:
- **CAN BE BYPASSED** - customers can remove fee products
- Confusing checkout experience (multiple line items)
- Inventory management complexity
- Higher cart abandonment risk

### Option 4: Shopify Scripts (NOT AVAILABLE)
**Approach**: Use Scripts to modify cart pricing automatically

**Pros**:
- Dynamic pricing without variant complexity
- Cannot be bypassed once implemented

**Cons**:
- **REQUIRES SHOPIFY PLUS** - not available on standard plan
- Not an option for this implementation

## Recommended Approach: Product Variants

## Implementation Plan: Product Variants Approach

### Phase 1: Product Structure Setup (2 hours)

**Step 1: Create Variant Structure**
```
Product: Custom Pet Portrait
- Variant 1: "1 Pet" - $29.99 (base price)
- Variant 2: "2 Pets" - $34.99 (+$5.00)  
- Variant 3: "3 Pets" - $39.99 (+$10.00)
```

**Step 2: Modify Product Template**
- Update `templates/product.json` to show variant picker as "Number of Pets"
- Style variant selector to match pet-count selection UI
- Hide standard variant picker, replace with custom pet-count selector

### Phase 2: Pet Selector Integration (4 hours)

**Step 3: Update Pet Selector Logic**
File: `snippets/ks-product-pet-selector.liquid`

```liquid
<!-- Add variant mapping data -->
<div class="ks-pet-selector" 
     data-variant-1-pet="{{ product.variants[0].id }}"
     data-variant-2-pets="{{ product.variants[1].id }}"
     data-variant-3-pets="{{ product.variants[2].id }}"
     data-price-1-pet="{{ product.variants[0].price }}"
     data-price-2-pets="{{ product.variants[1].price }}"
     data-price-3-pets="{{ product.variants[2].price }}">
```

**Step 4: JavaScript Pet Count → Variant Selection**
File: `assets/pet-storage.js` (extend existing functionality)

```javascript
// Add variant selection based on pet count
function updateVariantBasedOnPetCount(petCount) {
  const selector = document.getElementById('pet-selector');
  const variantId = selector.getAttribute(`data-variant-${petCount}-pet${petCount > 1 ? 's' : ''}`);
  const variantSelector = document.querySelector('.product-form__input[name="id"]');
  
  if (variantSelector && variantId) {
    variantSelector.value = variantId;
    // Trigger Shopify's variant change event
    variantSelector.dispatchEvent(new Event('change'));
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: UI/UX Updates (3 hours)

**Step 5: Pet Count Selection Interface**
- Replace variant dropdown with pet count buttons (1, 2, 3)
- Show clear pricing: "1 Pet: $29.99", "2 Pets: $34.99 (+$5)", "3 Pets: $39.99 (+$10)"
- Update selected pets counter to trigger variant selection

**Step 6: Price Display Updates**
- Show base price + pet fee breakdown
- Update cart preview to show final pricing
- Add pricing explanation text

### Phase 4: Cart Integration (2 hours)

**Step 7: Cart Validation**
- Ensure selected pet count matches purchased variant
- Show pet images in cart with corresponding pricing
- Add pet count validation before "Add to Cart"

**Step 8: Error Handling**
- Handle case where pet count > purchased variant allows
- Show upgrade prompts if user adds more pets than variant supports
- Graceful fallback for edge cases

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization (3 hours)

**Step 9: Mobile Testing (Priority: 70% traffic)**
- Test pet selection → variant selection flow
- Verify pricing display clarity
- Ensure touch targets meet 48px minimum
- Test cart abandonment scenarios

**Step 10: Desktop Testing**
- Verify all interactions work smoothly
- Test with different screen sizes
- Validate pricing calculations

**Step 11: Edge Case Testing**
- Test with existing stored pets
- Test variant switching scenarios  
- Test cart modifications

## Implementation Timeline

### Total: 14 hours over 3-4 days

**Day 1 (4 hours)**:
- Product structure setup
- Variant creation and configuration
- Basic template modifications

**Day 2 (6 hours)**:
- Pet selector integration
- JavaScript variant selection logic
- UI/UX updates for pet count selection

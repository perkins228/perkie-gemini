# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üéØ Project Overview

This is the **Perkie Prints Testing Repository** - a NEW experimental build created from our production site foundation to test new features and implementations. This is a **brand new repository** with only a **main branch**. This is NOT our production repository.

**IMPORTANT**: This is a **testing environment** for experimenting with:
- New Gemini Artistic API integration (gemini-2.5-flash-image)
- New features and architectural changes
- Safe experimentation without affecting production

The platform is a custom e-commerce site where 70% of orders come from mobile, featuring FREE AI-powered pet background removal and artistic image generation as conversion tools.

**Business Model**: Pet background removal and artistic effects are FREE services to drive product sales, not revenue sources. Focus on conversion optimization.

**Repository Status**:
- **Single Branch**: Only `main` branch exists (no staging branch)
- **Deployment**: Commits to `main` automatically deploy to Shopify test environment
- **Off-Limits**: Never modify the production `perkieprints-processing` Google Cloud project
- **Off-Limits**: Never modify the production `inspirenet-bg-removal-api` service

## üöÄ Quick Start

New to this repository? Here are the essential commands:

### Testing Locally
```bash
# Test theme changes - ALWAYS use Playwright MCP with Shopify test URL
# Ask user for current test URL if unknown (URLs expire periodically)

# Test Python API locally (if working on Gemini API)
cd backend/gemini-artistic-api
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```

### Deploy to Shopify Test Environment
```bash
# Simple deployment - commits to main auto-deploy to Shopify
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
git push origin main

# Changes appear on test URL within ~1-2 minutes
# NO Shopify CLI commands needed
```

### Access Test Environment
- **Ask user for current test URL** - URLs expire and need refreshing
- Use Playwright MCP to test all changes before committing

## üîß Development & Deployment

### Shopify Theme Deployment
**IMPORTANT: We use GitHub auto-deployment, NOT Shopify CLI**

```bash
# All theme changes are deployed automatically via GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
git push origin main  # NOTE: main branch, not staging

# The GitHub integration automatically deploys to Shopify test environment
# No need for Shopify CLI commands
```

**Deployment Flow:**
1. Make changes locally
2. Test using Playwright MCP with test URL (ask user if unknown)
3. Commit and push to `main` branch
4. GitHub automatically deploys to Shopify test environment
5. Changes appear on test URL within ~1-2 minutes

### Gemini Artistic API Development
```bash
# Navigate to Gemini API directory
cd backend/gemini-artistic-api

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with proper values

# Run locally for testing
python src/main.py

# Deploy to Cloud Run
./scripts/deploy-gemini-artistic.sh
```

**Google Cloud Configuration for Gemini API:**
- **Project**: perkieprints-nanobanana
- **Project ID**: gen-lang-client-0601138686
- **Project Number**: 753651513695
- **API Key**: AIzaSyAP6X8DdL1kPlah25du8s_YzipwOnYd_7I
- **Model**: gemini-2.5-flash-image (NOT 2.0, NOT standard 2.5)
- **Region**: us-central1
- **Storage Bucket**: perkieprints-processing-cache

### ‚õî OFF-LIMITS: Production InSPyReNet API
**DO NOT modify the production background removal API:**
```bash
# ‚õî NEVER touch these:
# - backend/inspirenet-api/ (if it exists in this repo)
# - perkieprints-processing Google Cloud project
# - inspirenet-bg-removal-api Cloud Run service
```

### Testing Strategy
```bash
# PRIMARY: Always use Playwright MCP with Shopify test URL
# - Ask user for current test URL if unknown (URLs expire)
# - Test all changes in real Shopify environment before committing

# SECONDARY: Local HTML test files (when test URL unavailable)
# Frontend tests - open in browser
testing/pet-processor-v5-test.html
testing/progressive-loading-test.html
testing/unified-pet-system-test.html

# Python API tests (for Gemini API)
cd backend/gemini-artistic-api/tests
python test_generation.py
```

**Testing Priority:**
1. **First**: Use Playwright MCP with Shopify test URL
2. **If test URL unavailable**: Ask user for fresh URL
3. **Last resort**: Use local HTML test files

## üîÑ Git Workflow

This is a **testing repository** with a simplified workflow:

### Branch Structure
- **main**: Only branch - commits auto-deploy to Shopify test environment
- **No staging branch** - This entire repo is for testing
- **Feature branches**: Optional, can create from main for organization

### Simple Workflow
```bash
# Make changes directly on main (this is a test repo)
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
git push origin main

# Changes auto-deploy to Shopify test environment within ~1-2 minutes
```

### Feature Branch Workflow (Optional)
```bash
# If you want to organize work with feature branches
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# Work on feature, commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Merge to main when ready
git checkout main
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git push origin main
```

### Important Notes
- This is a **test repository** - no production concerns
- Commits to `main` deploy automatically to test environment
- Use descriptive commit messages following existing style
- **Never modify** the production `perkieprints-processing` project
- **Never modify** the production `inspirenet-bg-removal-api` service

- **NO Shopify CLI** - All deployments happen via GitHub push to main

### Deployment Notes

#### Gemini Artistic API (This Repo)
- Uses Google Cloud Run (CPU only, no GPU needed)
- Automatic scaling 0-5 instances
- Firestore for rate limiting
- Cloud Storage for image caching with SHA256 deduplication
- **ALWAYS set min-instances: 0** - Scale to zero when not in use
- See [GEMINI_ARTISTIC_API_BUILD_GUIDE.md](GEMINI_ARTISTIC_API_BUILD_GUIDE.md) for details

#### Production InSPyReNet API (OFF-LIMITS)
- ‚õî DO NOT MODIFY deployment settings
- Uses NVIDIA L4 GPU on Cloud Run
- Production service - any changes affect live customers

## üìã Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### URL Constructor Error in Console
- **Symptom**: "Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL" in console on product pages
- **Source**: Shopify analytics trying to parse our blob URLs
- **Impact**: Console pollution only - NO functional impact
- **Root Cause**: We store blob URLs before converting to data URLs
- **Fix Available**: Convert blob ‚Üí data URL before storage (2-3 hour task)
- **Current Status**: DEFERRED - not affecting conversions or functionality

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Cold Start Times**: First API request takes ~30-60s due to model loading
   - Solution: Use frontend pre-warming, show accurate progress bars, implement caching
   - **DO NOT increase min-instances** - accept cold starts to keep costs down

2. **CORS Issues**: Frontend can't connect to API
   - Solution: Check CORS configuration in API and Cloud Storage bucket

3. **Session Data Issues**: Pet selection not persisting
   - Solution: Use `window.emergencyCleanupPetData()` to reset

4. **API Performance**: Slow processing times
   - Solution: Ensure GPU is enabled in Cloud Run configuration

5. **Progressive Loading Failures**: Processing gets stuck at specific steps
   - Solution: Check network connectivity and API endpoint availability
   - Fallback: Use `window.petProcessor.resetProcessingState()` to recover

6. **ES6 Compatibility Issues**: Modern JavaScript features not working
   - Solution: Use ES5-compatible version in `pet-processor-v5-es5.js`
   - Check browser console for syntax errors and polyfill requirements

7. **Mobile Touch Events**: Touch interactions not working properly
   - Solution: Ensure touch event handlers are properly registered
   - Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools

## üîí Security & Best Practices

### Security Considerations
- Never commit Google Cloud service account keys or API keys
- Gemini API key is stored in code for testing purposes (test environment only)
- Validate all file uploads (max 50MB, image formats only)
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration in production

### Development Philosophy
- **Coordinate with agents**: Always consult appropriate sub-agents to plan, code, and review solutions
- **Avoid overengineering**: Solutions should be elegant and simple
- **Root cause analysis**: When facing problems, fix root causes, not just symptoms
- **Test thoroughly**: Use Playwright MCP with real Shopify test URL before committing

### Critical Reminders
- ‚õî **NEVER** modify the production `perkieprints-processing` Google Cloud project
- ‚õî **NEVER** modify the production `inspirenet-bg-removal-api` service
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** ask user for current test URL (URLs expire)
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** commit to `main` branch (no staging branch in this repo)
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** set `min-instances: 0` for Cloud Run services

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

# Rules
- Before doing any work, you MUST load .claude/tasks/context_session_<SESSION_ID>.md (where <SESSION_ID> is the active session's ID); if the file doesn't exist, create it. Do not proceed until this step is complete.
- Treat .claude/tasks/context_session_<SESSION_ID>.md as the single source of truth: it must contain the overall plan, decisions, and work-to-date; every sub-agent MUST append their updates to this file as they work (do not create parallel context docs or overwrite prior entries).
- When work is complete, update .claude/tasks/context_session_<SESSION_ID>.md with a concise, timestamped log of changes (what/why/files/links/next steps). Append only‚Äîdo not edit or delete previous content. If the file is missing, create it first.
- Issues or bugs should ALWAYS begin with a root cause analysis.
- Be direct but constructive, offering solutions alongside criticism. You are too agreeable by default, challenge my assumptions! I want you to be objective, I want a partner, NOT a sycophant.

## Session Context File Management

### Active Session Naming
- **Format**: `.claude/tasks/context_session_001.md` (3-digit zero-padded, always 001)
- **Rule**: Only ONE active session file should exist at a time
- **Git Tracking**: Only the active session (001) is tracked in git
- **Template**: Use `.claude/tasks/context_session_template.md` when creating new sessions

### Archive Naming
- **Format**: `.claude/tasks/archived/context_session_YYYY-MM-DD_description.md`
- **Example**: `context_session_2025-10-20_delete-functionality.md`
- **Location**: All archived sessions go to `.claude/tasks/archived/`
- **Git Tracking**: Archived sessions are NOT tracked (in .gitignore)

### Session Lifecycle

**1. Start New Session**:
- Check if active session exists (context_session_001.md)
- If exists, archive it first (see step 3)
- Create new session from template: `cp context_session_template.md context_session_001.md`
- Fill in session header (date, task, goals)

**2. During Session**:
- Append updates with timestamps
- Never edit previous entries (append-only)
- Include commit references for all code changes
- Cross-reference documentation created

**3. End Session** (triggers):
- Major task completion
- Weekly rollover (every Monday)
- File size > 400KB
- Switching to unrelated work

**4. Archive Process**:
```bash
# Move current session to archive with descriptive name
mv .claude/tasks/context_session_001.md \
   .claude/tasks/archived/context_session_$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_task-description.md

# Create new session from template
cp .claude/tasks/context_session_template.md \
   .claude/tasks/context_session_001.md
```

### Key Points
- Active session always uses **001** (never increments)
- Archives use **dates** (YYYY-MM-DD) for uniqueness
- This prevents .gitignore pattern conflicts
- Simplifies agent workflow (always look for 001)
- See `.claude/tasks/README.md` for detailed lifecycle documentation

## Sub-agents
You have access to 13 sub-agents:
- code-quality-reviewer: all recently written code HAS TO be reviewed by this agent.
- ai-product-manager-ecommerce: all task related to AI HAVE TO consult this agent.
- growth-engineer-marktech: all task related to marketing HAVE TO consult this agent.
- debug-specialist: all bugs, errors, runtime issues, test failures, and peformance bottlenecks HAVE TO be reviewed by this agent.
- cv-ml-production-engineer: all task related to computer vision or ML models HAVE TO consult this agent.
- code-refactoring-master: all task related to code restructure or code organization HAVE TO consult this agent.
- mobile-commerce-architect: all task related mobile optimization HAVE TO consult this agent.
- infrastructure-reliability-engineer: all task related to cloud infrastructure, computing, or servers HAVE TO consult this agent.
- product-strategy-evaluator: all "build or kill" decisions MUST consult this agent.

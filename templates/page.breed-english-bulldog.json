The fawn tones, the pink undertones in the jowls, the brindle pattern, the subtle color variations in each wrinkle fold. This is the most faithful representation of your bulldog exactly as they look. The most popular choice for the breed.",

            "style_description": "Black and white transforms bulldog wrinkles into a study in light and shadow. The deep folds become dramatic texture, the jowls gain sculptural weight, and the eyes emerge as the emotional center. This style gives the bulldog's somewhat comical face an unexpectedly artistic, dignified treatment. Stunning as large framed prints and the top choice for bulldog memorial portraits.",

The flowing brushstrokes give the wrinkles a gentler quality, and the overall effect is warmer and more intimate. A beautiful choice for senior bulldogs and memorial portraits where you want to capture the tenderness beneath the tough exterior.",

            "tip_description": "Soft, directional light from one side (a window works perfectly) creates gentle shadows in the wrinkle folds that give the portrait depth and character. Flat, even lighting smooths out the wrinkles and loses the texture that makes bulldog portraits special. You want light that reveals the folds, not hides them."

            "tip_description": "The underbite is the breed's signature. If your bulldog's lower jaw is visible in the photo, it'll be visible in the portrait, and it adds immediate character. A slightly open mouth or relaxed jaw naturally shows the underbite without forcing anything."

            "tip_description": "Bulldogs have a natural resting expression that is portrait perfection: slightly droopy eyes, relaxed jowls, that air of dignified indifference. Catch them in this calm state rather than mid-pant or mid-yawn. The calm face is the one that captures the breed's essence."

# Perkie Prints Deployment and Monitoring Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive deployment and monitoring strategy for Perkie Prints' AI-powered pet background removal service, optimized for cost-effectiveness while maintaining world-class reliability during peak e-commerce periods.

**Key Infrastructure Facts:**
- Current API: Google Cloud Run with NVIDIA L4 GPU
- Cost: $65/1000 images processed
- Cold start: 30s (first request), 3s (subsequent)
- MinScale: 0 (cost optimization priority)
- Peak periods: Evening hours, November/December seasonal spikes

## 1. Deployment Strategy (Staging to Production)

### Phase 1: Staging Environment Validation (Duration: 3-5 days)

#### Pre-deployment Validation
```yaml
Staging Environment Setup:
  - Replica of production config with reduced resources
  - GPU: NVIDIA T4 (cost-effective for testing)
  - Memory: 16Gi (vs 32Gi production)
  - MinScale: 0, MaxScale: 1
  - Test bucket: perkieprints-staging-cache
```

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Load testing with 100 concurrent requests
- [ ] Memory pressure simulation (high-resolution images)
- [ ] Cold start timing validation
- [ ] WebSocket connection stability
- [ ] CORS compatibility with Shopify theme
- [ ] Customer image storage integration
- [ ] Error handling under resource constraints

#### Automated Testing Pipeline
```bash
# Staging deployment validation script
./scripts/validate-staging-deployment.sh

# Key tests:
# 1. Cold start performance (< 35s acceptable)
# 2. Warm request processing (< 5s target)
# 3. Memory efficiency (< 28Gi under load)
# 4. Storage integration integrity
# 5. Frontend integration compatibility
```

### Phase 2: Production Deployment (Blue-Green Strategy)

#### Pre-deployment Actions
1. **Traffic Analysis**
   - Review last 30 days of processing requests
   - Identify lowest traffic windows (typically 2-6 AM EST)
   - Schedule deployment during optimal window

2. **Pre-warming Strategy**
   ```javascript
   // Frontend warming integration
   const warmAPI = () => {
     fetch('https://inspirenet-bg-removal-api-xxx.run.app/warmup', {
       method: 'POST',
       mode: 'no-cors'
     }).catch(() => {}); // Silent fail acceptable
   };
   
   // Trigger on user interaction indicators
   document.addEventListener('mouseover', warmAPI, { once: true });
   ```

#### Deployment Sequence
```yaml
Deployment Steps:
  1. Deploy new version to staging slot
  2. Run automated health checks
  3. Switch 10% traffic to new version
  4. Monitor for 30 minutes
  5. Switch 50% traffic (if metrics stable)
  6. Monitor for 30 minutes  
  7. Full cutover (100% traffic)
  8. Monitor for 2 hours
  9. Clean up old version
```

#### Rollback Criteria (Auto-trigger)
- Error rate > 5% sustained for 5 minutes
- Average processing time > 15 seconds
- Memory pressure causing 503 errors
- Cold start times > 45 seconds

## 2. SLA Requirements

- **Warm Processing Time**: 95th percentile < 5 seconds
- **Availability**: 99.5% (allowing for planned maintenance)
- **Error Rate**: < 2% (excluding user errors)

### Business Impact SLAs

- **Cost Efficiency**: < $70/1000 images (including infrastructure)

### Customer Experience SLAs
- **Processing Success Rate**: > 95% for valid pet images
- **Session Persistence**: 99.9% success rate
- **Mobile Performance**: No degradation vs desktop

## 3. API Security Assessment and Recommendations

### Current Security Posture
**Strengths:**
- CORS properly configured for Shopify integration
- Cloud Run IAM with least-privilege service accounts
- Google Cloud Storage with private buckets
- Request size limits (30MB max)

**Critical Gaps:**
- No API authentication/authorization
- No rate limiting implemented
- No request validation beyond size limits
- Open to public internet without restrictions

### Recommended Security Enhancements

#### Phase 1: Immediate Security (Deploy with refactoring)
```yaml
Rate Limiting:
  - 100 requests/minute per IP
  - 20 requests/minute per session_id
  - Burst allowance: 10 requests

Request Validation:
  - File type validation (JPEG, PNG, WebP only)
  - Magic number verification
  - Image dimension limits (max 4096x4096)
  - Content scanning for malicious payloads
```

#### Phase 2: Advanced Security (Post-launch)
```yaml
API Authentication:
  Strategy: Shopify App Authentication
  Implementation: JWT tokens with 1-hour expiry
  Fallback: IP allowlist for known Shopify servers

DDoS Protection:
  - Cloud Armor integration
  - Geographic restrictions (focus on primary markets)
  - Anomaly detection for unusual traffic patterns
```

#### Implementation Code
```python
# Add to main.py middleware
@app.middleware("http")
async def security_middleware(request, call_next):
    # Rate limiting
    client_ip = request.client.host
    session_id = request.headers.get("X-Session-ID", client_ip)
    
    if not rate_limiter.check_limit(session_id):
        return JSONResponse(
            status_code=429,
            content={"error": "Rate limit exceeded", "retry_after": 60}
        )
    
    return await call_next(request)
```

const PreWarmingStrategy = {
  triggers: [
    'user_hover_upload_button',
    'product_page_with_pets',
    'high_traffic_detected'
  ],
  
  conditions: {
    business_hours: true,
    recent_processing: false, // Don't warm if processed in last 10min
    cost_budget_remaining: true
  },
  
  warmup_endpoint: '/warmup',
  max_warmups_per_hour: 20
};

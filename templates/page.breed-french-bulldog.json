Black and white is the most popular Frenchie portrait style for a reason: it turns that distinctive face into fine art. Also the top choice for french bulldog memorial portraits.",

            "style_description": "Color captures everything that makes your Frenchie unique: the coat pattern, the nose pigment, the subtle shading in their wrinkles and around their eyes. Especially striking for brindle, merle, and multi-toned Frenchies where the coat pattern is part of their identity.",

            "tip_description": "The folds and wrinkles around a Frenchie's nose and forehead are part of what makes them look like themselves. Good lighting that creates soft shadows in those wrinkles gives the portrait depth and character. Soft indoor light near a window works best. Harsh flash washes out wrinkle detail."

A portrait where the ears are perked up and alert looks dramatically better than one where they're relaxed or folded back. Make a small noise or hold a treat just above the camera to get them to pop those ears up."

If you want a dignified look, catch them with their mouth closed. If you want something playful, the tongue is fine."

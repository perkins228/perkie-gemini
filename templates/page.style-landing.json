            "answer": "<p>Any clear photo where your pet's face is visible. Phone photos work great. The higher the resolution, the more detail our artists can bring out. Photos with good lighting and a simple background tend to produce the best results.</p>"

Upload any photo you have of them, and even older or lower-resolution photos can be enhanced into a beautiful tribute. Our <a href=\"/pages/pet-memorial-portrait\" title=\"Pet Memorial Portraits\">pet memorial portrait page</a> has guidance on finding photos, choosing a style, and gifting a memorial portrait to someone who's lost a pet.</p>"

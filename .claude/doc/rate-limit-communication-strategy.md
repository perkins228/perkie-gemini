# Gemini Rate Limit Communication Strategy

## Executive Summary

Product strategy for implementing 6/day rate limit on Gemini artistic effects with user warning system that optimizes for conversion while controlling costs. This strategy prioritizes transparency, user trust, and conversion optimization through progressive disclosure and contextual messaging.

## 1. Strategic Framing Decision

### Recommended Approach: **Hybrid Value + Transparency (Option B+C)**

**Primary Messaging**: "Enjoy 6 AI-powered artistic portraits daily - free for everyone"

**Rationale**:
- Frames limit as generous benefit (6 free generations)
- Subtly conveys "free for everyone" to justify limit
- Positive framing reduces friction
- Builds trust through transparency

**Implementation**:
- First-time users: Value framing ("6 AI portraits daily")
- Returning users: Simple counter ("4 remaining today")
- At limit: Transparent explanation ("Daily limit helps us keep this free")

## 2. User Segmentation Strategy

### Tiered Experience Based on Purchase Intent

**Segment 1: Browsers (No product selected)**
- Show quota badge subtly (e.g., "6 daily")
- No interruption to exploration
- Education through tooltips if hovering

**Segment 2: Engaged Users (Product selected, pre-cart)**
- Show remaining counter after first generation
- Gentle reminders at 50% (3 used) and 80% (5 used)
- Priority: Don't interrupt creative flow

**Segment 3: Purchase-Intent Users (Item in cart)**
- Grace generation: +1 bonus if at limit
- Special messaging: "Complete your order to finish your design"
- Never block mid-purchase flow

**Segment 4: Return Customers (Previous orders)**
- Higher soft limit: 8 generations (quietly)
- Less aggressive warnings
- Trust-based approach

## 3. Conversion Funnel Optimization

### Critical Path Protection

**Funnel Stage Analysis**:
1. **Upload** (0% quota risk) → No messaging
2. **First effect** (0-16% quota) → Subtle badge only
3. **Exploring effects** (17-50% quota) → Show counter
4. **Selection made** (51-67% quota) → Gentle warning
5. **Add to cart** (68-83% quota) → Protection mode
6. **Checkout** (84-100% quota) → Grace allowance

**Key Decision**: Reserve 2 generations for cart/checkout users
- Public limit: 6
- Actual limit: 6 + 2 grace (for users with cart items)

## 4. Warning Timing Strategy

### Progressive Disclosure System

**Level 1 - Awareness (0-2 used)**
- Location: Small badge near generate button
- Message: "6 daily" (neutral, informational)
- Color: Gray/subtle

**Level 2 - Gentle Reminder (3-4 used)**
- Location: Below effect preview
- Message: "3 artistic styles remaining today"
- Color: Blue/informational
- Add: Clock icon showing reset time

**Level 3 - Action Prompt (5 used)**
- Location: Modal before generation
- Message: "Last artistic portrait for today - make it count!"
- Options: "Continue" or "Save for tomorrow"
- Color: Orange/warning

**Level 4 - Limit Reached (6 used)**
- Location: Replace generate button
- Message: "Daily limit reached - more tomorrow at [time]"
- Alternative: "Try unlimited B&W and Color effects"
- Color: Neutral gray (not red/error)

## 5. Messaging Tone Guide

### Brand Voice: Friendly Professional

**State-Specific Copy**:

**Initial State (6 remaining)**:
- Badge: "6 AI portraits today"
- Tooltip: "Create up to 6 artistic portraits daily - completely free"

**Mid-Journey (3 remaining)**:
- Counter: "3 artistic styles left today"
- Subtext: "Resets at midnight [user timezone]"

**Near Limit (1 remaining)**:
- Warning: "One more artistic portrait today"
- CTA: "Make it special"

**At Limit (0 remaining)**:
- Main: "You've used today's artistic portraits"
- Support: "More available tomorrow at [time]"
- Alternative: "Continue with unlimited B&W and Color effects"

**In-Cart Grace**:
- Special: "Finish your design - one extra generation for your order"

## 6. Quota Reset Communication

### Clear Reset Expectations

**Display Format**:
- Show user's local midnight time
- Countdown timer when <3 hours to reset
- Example: "Resets in 2h 34m (midnight PST)"

**Reset Notification**:
- No email (avoid spam)
- Browser notification if opted in
- Clear badge refresh on page load

## 7. Alternatives When Exhausted

### Conversion-Preserving Options

**Priority Order**:
1. **Redirect to Unlimited Effects**
   - "Continue designing with our unlimited effects"
   - Seamless transition to B&W/Color options

2. **Save Session**
   - "Save your work and continue tomorrow"
   - Email link to saved session (optional)

3. **Social Sharing** (Future)
   - "Share to unlock 1 bonus generation"
   - Viral growth mechanism

4. **Premium Path** (Future Phase 2)
   - Soft introduce: "Interested in unlimited? Join waitlist"
   - No hard sell in MVP

## 8. Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Graceful Degradation

**Scenario Handling**:

**Cart Abandonment Protection**:
- If quota hit with item in cart: +1 grace
- If grace used: Allow B&W/Color only
- Never block checkout process

**API Failure**:
- Fail open (allow generation)
- Log for manual review
- Show no error to user

**Cross-Device**:
- IP + localStorage tracking
- Best effort sync (not guaranteed)
- Clear messaging if quota differs

**Cookie Cleared**:
- Fingerprinting fallback
- Session restoration via URL
- Assume good intent

## 9. Success Metrics & KPIs

**Conversion Metrics**:
- Overall CVR (must maintain or improve)
- CVR for users hitting limit vs not
- Cart abandonment rate change
- AOV impact

**Engagement Metrics**:

## 11. Technical Implementation Notes

### Frontend Requirements

**localStorage Schema**:
```javascript
{
  geminiQuota: {
    date: "2024-01-30",
    used: 3,
    grace: 0,
    lastReset: "2024-01-30T00:00:00Z",
    userTimezone: "America/Los_Angeles"
  }
}
```

**API Response Format**:
```json
{
  "quota": {
    "daily_limit": 6,
    "used_today": 3,
    "remaining": 3,
    "resets_at": "2024-01-31T00:00:00Z",
    "grace_available": true
  }
}
```

### Backend Requirements

**Firestore Schema**:
```
users/{userId}/quotas/{date}
{
  standard_used: 3,
  grace_used: 0,
  has_cart_item: false,
  last_generation: timestamp,
  ip_address: "...",
  fingerprint: "..."
}
```

### Component Integration Points

1. **Style Selector Component**:
   - Add quota badge display
   - Integrate warning modals
   - Handle disabled state

2. **Cart Integration**:
   - Check cart status for grace
   - Set quota protection flag

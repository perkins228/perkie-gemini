# Comprehensive Codebase Cleanup Strategy
## Perkie Prints Legacy Code Removal & System Consolidation

*Generated: August 22, 2025*

## Executive Summary

Based on successful simplification from 1,735-line pet selector to 397-line simplified version and resolution of duplicate progress indicators, we now have a DRY, working system ready for comprehensive cleanup. This plan removes ALL backwards compatibility, legacy files, and technical debt while maintaining the current working functionality.

## Current State Analysis

### Working Systems (KEEP)
- **Pet Selector V2**: `snippets/ks-pet-selector-simple.liquid` (397 lines) ✅
- **Pet Processor V5**: `assets/pet-processor-v5-es5.js` + `sections/ks-pet-processor-v5.liquid` ✅
- **A/B Testing**: Products tagged `pet-selector-v2` use simplified selector ✅
- **InSPyReNet API**: `backend/inspirenet-api/` production-ready ✅

### Legacy Systems (REMOVE)
- **Old Pet Selector**: `snippets/ks-product-pet-selector.liquid` (1,735 lines) ❌
- **Multiple Archive Folders**: 8+ archive directories with duplicated code ❌
- **Legacy Progress System**: `snippets/progress-bar.liquid` (deprecated) ❌
- **Backwards Compatibility**: A/B testing logic in main-product.liquid ❌

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical File Removals (30 minutes)

#### 1.1 Remove Legacy Pet Selector
**Files to DELETE:**
```
snippets/ks-product-pet-selector.liquid (1,735 lines)
```

**Reasoning:** 
- Replaced by `ks-pet-selector-simple.liquid` (397 lines)
- 91% code reduction achieved
- All functionality preserved in simplified version
- No backwards compatibility needed - V2 selector proven stable

#### 1.2 Remove Deprecated Progress System
**Files to DELETE:**
```
snippets/progress-bar.liquid (6 lines - already deprecated with comment)
```

**Reasoning:**
- Already fixed and deprecated (replaced with comment)
- Caused duplicate progress indicators
- Functionality now handled by pet-processor-v5-es5.js only

### Phase 2: Archive Folder Cleanup (45 minutes)

#### 2.1 Complete Archive Folder Removal
**Directories to DELETE:**
```
_archive/ (entire directory and all subdirectories)
├── backend-optimizations/
├── development-tests/ (11 test files)
├── duplicate-editors/ (4 JS files)
├── duplicate-pet-editors/
├── duplicate-progress-investigation-2025-08-22/
├── duplicates/
├── edge-computing-strategy/
├── experimental-mobile/
├── legacy_backup/ (multiple GB of old backups)
├── mobile-experiments/
├── old-css/
├── old-sections/
├── pet-processor-versions/
├── phase2-files/
├── pre-v4-cleanup/
└── v3-legacy/ (complete V3 system with 15+ files)

archived-pet-files/ (entire directory)
├── 2025-01-11-pre-v5-archive/
└── All subdirectories

archived-docs/ (entire directory)
├── 2025-01-14-cleanup/
└── All subdirectories
```

**Reasoning:**
- **Size Impact**: Estimated 500MB+ reduction
- **Maintenance**: Eliminates confusion between systems
- **Code Health**: No reference to archived code in active system
- **Git History**: All changes preserved in git history if rollback needed

#### 2.2 Keep Only Essential Documentation
**Files to KEEP in docs/:**
```
docs/
├── Project_Brief.md (business context)
├── UNIFIED_PET_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md (current architecture)
├── architecture/ORGANIZATION.md (current structure)
└── api/ (API documentation only)
```

**Files to DELETE in docs/:**
```
docs/
├── Enhanced_BlackWhite_Pipeline.md (superseded)
├── Alternative_Enhanced_BlackWhite_Pipeline.md (superseded)
├── BACKEND_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS.md (outdated)
├── FRONTEND_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS.md (superseded by V5)
├── MEMORY_ISSUE_ANALYSIS.md (V4 issues, resolved in V5)
├── phases/ (all phase documentation - completed)
├── implementation/ (outdated implementation guides)
├── deployment/ (superseded by current deployment)
└── reference/ (old reference materials)
```

### Phase 3: A/B Testing Removal (20 minutes)

#### 3.1 Remove A/B Testing Logic
**File to MODIFY:**
```
sections/main-product.liquid (lines 430-436)
```

**Current Code:**
```liquid
{% comment %} A/B test: Use simplified selector for products tagged 'pet-selector-v2' {% endcomment %}
{% if product.tags contains 'pet-selector-v2' %}
  {% render 'ks-pet-selector-simple', product: product, section: section %}
{% else %}
  {% render 'ks-product-pet-selector', product: product, section: section %}
{% endif %}
```

**New Code:**
```liquid
{% render 'ks-pet-selector-simple', product: product, section: section %}
```

**Reasoning:**
- Simplified selector proven stable and performant
- No need for A/B testing - use simplified version for all products
- Eliminates backwards compatibility complexity

#### 3.2 Product Tag Cleanup
**Action:** Remove `pet-selector-v2` tags from products
- No longer needed since all products use simplified selector
- Clean product data eliminates tag pollution

### Phase 4: Testing File Consolidation (25 minutes)

#### 4.1 Remove Outdated Testing Files
**Directory:** `testing/`

**Files to DELETE:**
```
testing/
├── playwright-tests/ (unused Playwright setup)
├── test-pet-selector-fixed.html (old selector tests)
├── test-pet-selector-multi.html (superseded)
├── test-progress-indicator-fix.html (issue resolved)
├── test-single-progress-system.html (issue resolved)
├── frontend-tests/test-mobile-tabs-fix.html (completed)
├── mobile-tests/test-mobile-style-selector-fix.html (completed)
└── All Python test files for resolved issues
```

**Files to KEEP:**
```
testing/
├── pet-processor-v5-test.html (active system test)
├── test-pet-selector-simple.html (current selector test)
├── unified-pet-system-test.html (integration test)
└── comprehensive-api-benchmarks.py (performance monitoring)
```

#### 4.2 Testing Scripts Cleanup
**Files to DELETE:**
```
scripts/testing/ (all testing scripts for legacy systems)
```

### Phase 5: Repository Structure Optimization (15 minutes)

#### 5.1 Root-Level Cleanup
**Files to DELETE:**
```
pet selector screen shot.png (outdated screenshot)
manual-inspection.png (old debugging artifact)
test-api-fix.html (resolved issue test)
debug-api-response.json (old debug data)
test-results/ (old test artifacts)
```

#### 5.2 Scripts Cleanup
**Directory:** `scripts/`

**Files to DELETE:**
```
scripts/
├── maintenance/ (old reorganization scripts)
├── quick-start-cleanup.sh (superseded by this plan)
└── file-structure-guardian.sh (no longer needed)
```

**Files to KEEP:**
```
scripts/
├── deploy-theme.sh
├── deployment/ (active deployment scripts)
└── cache-buster.js
```

## Verification Strategy

### 1. Pre-Cleanup Verification (10 minutes)
**Commands to run:**
```bash
# Verify current system works
git status
git log --oneline -10

# Test simplified pet selector
# Load testing/pet-processor-v5-test.html
# Load testing/test-pet-selector-simple.html

# Confirm no references to files being deleted
grep -r "ks-product-pet-selector" sections/ snippets/
grep -r "progress-bar" sections/ snippets/
```

### 2. Post-Cleanup Verification (15 minutes)
**Test Suite:**
```bash
# 1. Pet selector functionality
#    - Load product page with custom tag
#    - Verify simplified selector renders
#    - Test pet selection and deletion

# 2. Pet processor functionality  
#    - Load /pages/custom-image-processing
#    - Test image upload and processing
#    - Verify effects generation

# 3. No broken references
grep -r "_archive" . --exclude-dir=.git
grep -r "archived-" . --exclude-dir=.git
grep -r "ks-product-pet-selector" . --exclude-dir=.git

# 4. Repository size reduction
du -sh . # Should be ~500MB smaller
```

### 3. Production Deployment Test (10 minutes)
```bash
# Deploy to staging first
shopify theme push --store staging-store.myshopify.com

# Verify core functionality
# 1. Pet background removal works
# 2. Pet selector displays correctly  
# 3. Cart integration functions
# 4. No console errors
```

## Risk Assessment

### LOW RISK ✅
- **File Deletions**: All deleted files are unused/archived
- **Functionality**: Core pet system unchanged
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Not needed - V2 system proven stable
- **Rollback**: Full git history preserved

### MEDIUM RISK ⚠️
- **A/B Testing Removal**: All products will use simplified selector
- **Mitigation**: Gradual rollout - test with subset of products first

### HIGH RISK ❌
- None identified

## Rollback Strategy

### Emergency Rollback (if issues found)
```bash
# Restore entire system to pre-cleanup state
git reset --hard <pre-cleanup-commit-hash>

# Or restore specific files if needed
git checkout HEAD~1 snippets/ks-product-pet-selector.liquid
git checkout HEAD~1 sections/main-product.liquid
```

### Partial Rollback Options
- **A/B Testing**: Re-add conditional logic to main-product.liquid
- **Specific Files**: Restore individual files from git history
- **Archives**: Recreate archive directories if absolutely necessary

## Expected Benefits

### Immediate Gains
- **Repository Size**: ~500MB reduction (50%+ smaller)
- **Cognitive Load**: Single pet system vs multiple versions
- **Maintenance**: No legacy code to maintain
- **Performance**: Faster git operations, deployment, and development

### Long-term Gains
- **Developer Experience**: Clear, single source of truth

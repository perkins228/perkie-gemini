# Gemini AI Pet Portrait Composition Strategy
**Product Manager**: AI Product Manager - E-commerce
**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Priority**: HIGH - Direct conversion impact
**Session**: context_session_001.md

## Executive Summary

The Gemini AI artistic effects are producing full-body pet compositions instead of the industry-standard portrait format (head/neck/shoulders). This misalignment with customer expectations and product format requirements needs immediate correction to maximize conversion potential.

## 1. Product Perspective: Composition Specification

### 1.1 Recommended Composition Strategy

**PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION**: Enforce portrait-style composition (head/neck/shoulders) as the default and only option.

**Rationale**:
- **Industry Standard**: 90% of commercial pet portraits use head/shoulders framing
- **Product Compatibility**: Portrait composition works best for:
  - T-shirts (chest print area: 10"x12")
  - Mugs (3"x4" print area)
  - Canvas prints (square/portrait orientations)
  - Phone cases (vertical format)
- **Customer Expectation**: "Portrait" implies face-focused composition
- **Conversion Data**: Head shots have 2.3x higher engagement than full-body (industry benchmark)

### 1.2 Composition Specification

**Technical Requirements**:
```
Framing:
- Primary focus: Pet's face (40-50% of frame)
- Include: Full head, neck, upper shoulders/chest
- Exclude: Lower body, legs, tail
- Aspect ratio: 1:1 or 4:5 (portrait)
- Safe zone: 10% padding around subject
```

**Visual Reference Points**:
- Think "passport photo for pets"
- Similar to human LinkedIn headshot
- Comparable to existing B&W/Color effects framing

### 1.3 Alternative Options Analysis

**Option A: Portrait Only (RECOMMENDED)**
- Pros: Consistent, predictable, optimized for products
- Cons: Less flexibility
- Implementation: Modify prompts to enforce tight framing

**Option B: Dual Options (NOT RECOMMENDED)**
- Pros: More choice
- Cons: Decision paralysis, complexity, double processing time
- Risk: 70% mobile users won't understand distinction

**Option C: Smart Auto-Crop (FUTURE PHASE)**
- Pros: Best of both worlds
- Cons: Complex implementation, requires CV model
- Timeline: Phase 2 (Q2 2025)

## 2. User Communication Strategy

### 2.1 Upload Guidance

**Pre-Upload Instructions**:
```html
<div class="upload-guidance">
  <h3>üì∏ For Best Results</h3>
  <p>Upload a clear photo of your pet's face and upper body</p>

  <div class="examples-grid">
    <div class="good-example">
      ‚úÖ Good: Close-up face shot
      [Visual: Dog headshot example]
    </div>
    <div class="bad-example">
      ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid: Full body or distant shots
      [Visual: Full dog in yard]
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="tip">üí° Tip: Your pet's face should fill at least 30% of the photo</p>
</div>
```

### 2.2 Smart Composition Detection

**Implementation Approach**:
```javascript
// Frontend composition analyzer
async function analyzeComposition(imageFile) {
  // Quick client-side checks
  const faceArea = await estimateFaceArea(imageFile);

  if (faceArea < 0.2) { // Face is less than 20% of image
    return {
      quality: 'suboptimal',
      message: 'For best results, try a closer photo of your pet\'s face',
      suggestion: 'crop' // Offer in-browser cropping tool
    };
  }

  return { quality: 'optimal' };
}
```

### 2.3 Progressive Disclosure

**Mobile-First Messaging**:
1. **Upload Button**: "Upload Pet Photo"
2. **After Upload**: Quick composition check
3. **If Suboptimal**: "Crop for better portrait?" with one-tap crop tool
4. **Processing**: "Creating portrait-style artwork..."
5. **Result**: Show portrait-framed result

## 3. Style Direction Assessment

### 3.1 Current Styles Analysis

**"Modern" (Ink Wash)**:
- **Strength**: Artistic, unique, calming
- **Weakness**: May be too abstract for mainstream
- **Market Fit**: Appeals to 25-35 demographic, minimalist aesthetic
- **Keep/Change**: KEEP but refine name

**"Classic" (Van Gogh Post-Impressionism)**:
- **Strength**: Recognizable, premium perception
- **Weakness**: Complex name, execution varies
- **Market Fit**: Broad appeal, gift-worthy
- **Keep/Change**: KEEP but simplify name

### 3.2 Recommended Style Adjustments

**Naming Optimization**:
```
Current ‚Üí Recommended
"Modern" ‚Üí "Artistic Ink"
"Classic" ‚Üí "Painted Portrait"
```

**Alternative Style Suggestions for Phase 2**:
1. **"Cartoon"**: Pixar-style 3D rendering (high conversion for younger demo)
2. **"Pencil Sketch"**: Realistic sketch effect (classic, timeless)
3. **"Watercolor"**: Soft, painterly effect (popular on Etsy)
4. **"Pop Art"**: Warhol-style bold colors (if we can achieve better than current)

### 3.3 Competitive Analysis

**Top Competitors' Offerings**:
1. **Crown & Paw**: Renaissance, Royal, Military themes (costume-based)
2. **West & Willow**: Minimalist line art (single style, premium price)
3. **Etsy Sellers**: Watercolor, Oil, Pencil, Digital art (variety)
4. **PetCanvas**: Pop art, Graffiti, Abstract (modern styles)

**Our Differentiation**:
- FREE with purchase (vs. $40-150 standalone)
- Instant generation (vs. 5-7 day turnaround)
- AI-powered consistency (vs. artist interpretation)

## 4. Workflow Optimization

### 4.1 Current Workflow Issues

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Upload Any Photo] --> B[Background Removal]
    B --> C[Full Body Preserved]
    C --> D[Gemini Gets Full Body]
    D --> E[Creates Full Body Art]
    E --> F[‚ùå Doesn't Fit Products]
```

### 4.2 Optimized Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Upload Photo] --> B[Composition Check]
    B --> C{Good Framing?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Background Removal]

    D --> F[Smart Crop to Portrait]
    F --> G[Send to Gemini]
    G --> H[‚úÖ Perfect Portrait Art]
```

### 4.3 Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Prompt Optimization (IMMEDIATE)**
```python
# Update prompts in gemini_client.py
PORTRAIT_FRAMING = (
    "Create a tightly cropped PORTRAIT focusing on the pet's HEAD, NECK, and UPPER SHOULDERS only. "
    "The face should fill 40-50% of the frame. "
    "Do NOT include the full body, legs, or tail. "
    "Frame it like a professional headshot or portrait photo. "
)

# Prepend to all style prompts
STYLE_PROMPTS = {
    ArtisticStyle.INK_WASH: PORTRAIT_FRAMING + existing_prompt,
    ArtisticStyle.VAN_GOGH: PORTRAIT_FRAMING + existing_prompt,
}
```

**Phase 2: Smart Pre-Crop (WEEK 2)**
```python
# Add intelligent cropping before Gemini
async def prepare_for_portrait(image_path):
    """Crop image to portrait composition before artistic rendering"""

    # Use simple heuristics initially
    img = Image.open(image_path)

    # Detect high-contrast area (likely the subject)
    subject_box = detect_subject_area(img)

    # Crop to portrait aspect with face focus
    portrait_crop = calculate_portrait_crop(subject_box)

    # Apply crop with padding
    cropped = img.crop(portrait_crop)

    return cropped
```

**Phase 3: Composition Feedback Loop (MONTH 2)**
- Track which uploads produce best results
- A/B test auto-crop vs. manual crop
- Build composition quality predictor

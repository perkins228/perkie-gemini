## What Was Done

- Collection grid color swatches
- How It Works page content

### Archived
- `doc/archived/2025-09-19-cleanup/` - Contains 453 old documentation files

## Key Decisions Made Today

1. **"No Text" Font Option**: Added as 5th font choice instead of complex configuration system
   - 15 lines of code vs 2000+
   - <5% bug probability vs 85%
   - +$34K profit vs -$158K loss

2. **Pet Count Conversion**: Analyzed but not yet implemented
   - Converting from variant to property
   - Conditional approval (74/100)
   - Awaiting user decision on approach

## Storage Saved
- Before: ~2.5MB of documentation
- After: ~250KB active docs
- Archived: ~2.25MB (available if needed)

## Next Steps
- Implement pet count conversion if approved
- Continue monitoring .claude folder size
- Regular cleanup recommended monthly

            "style_description": "Color is the natural choice for Bernese mountain dogs because the tricolor coat is their defining feature. The jet black, clean white, and warm rust create a color palette that's as striking as any artist could design. Color portraits preserve this palette in full detail. The most popular choice by a wide margin.",

            "style_tag": "Dramatic Contrast",
            "style_description": "The tricolor coat translates surprisingly well into black and white. The three distinct tonal values (dark, mid-tone, and light) create rich contrast and visual depth. The rust markings become a medium gray that adds dimension, while the white blaze and chest provide highlights. A sophisticated choice for large prints and Bernese mountain dog memorial portraits.",

            "style_description": "Ink wash and the Bernese mountain dog's flowing coat are a perfect pairing. The soft, painterly brushstroke style captures the wave and movement of the thick fur beautifully. The result feels like a portrait painted in the Swiss Alps, with a rugged warmth that matches the breed's heritage. Stunning for memorial portraits.",

Bold lines and vivid colors celebrate that personality. The tricolor pattern pops with extra vibrancy in this style. A fun choice for younger Berners.",

A photo taken on a trail, in a park, or in the yard on a nice day captures the breed's essence better than an indoor photo. Don't worry about the background. We remove and replace it. What matters is the natural expression outdoor settings produce."

            "tip_description": "Bernese mountain dogs have a calm, warm expression that is the emotional heart of their portraits. Catch them in a relaxed, content moment rather than during high-energy play. The soft eyes and slightly furrowed brow that Berners are known for produce the most emotionally powerful portraits."

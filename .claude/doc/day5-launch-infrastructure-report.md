  mobileFirst: true,
  successRate: 0.75  // target 75% warm hits
};
```

#### 5. Request Batching

## Conclusion

The InSPyReNet API is **technically ready for production** but facing a **critical adoption crisis**. The infrastructure is stable, cost-effective, and scalable. However, with only ~7 users in 24 hours, the business value is not being realized.

### Verdict: OPTIMIZE FOR ADOPTION

**Key Success Metrics for Week 2:**
1. Increase daily users from 7 to 50+
2. Reduce cold start rate from 50% to 30%
3. Improve instance efficiency from 39% to 60%
4. Maintain costs under $30/1000 images

**The infrastructure works. Now make users find and love it.**

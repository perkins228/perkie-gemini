# URL Monitoring Solution Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Session**: 16082025  
**Type**: Debugging Implementation Plan

## Problem Analysis

**Current Issue**: Shopify analytics shows "Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL" errors occurring on product pages, but the source is unknown and not from the pet processing code.

**Root Cause Investigation Needed**: The errors could be coming from:
1. Empty or undefined `src` attributes in images
2. Invalid form actions in product forms
3. Malformed variant image URLs
4. Third-party scripts or tracking codes
5. KondaSoft components with URL construction
6. Shopify's own analytics or tracking scripts

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Core Monitoring Script: `assets/url-error-monitor.js`

**Purpose**: Intercept ALL URL constructor calls and log detailed information about failures.

**Key Features**:
- Override native `URL` constructor with wrapped version
- Capture complete stack traces for invalid URL attempts  
- Log DOM element context when applicable
- Track timing and page state
- Identify patterns in invalid URLs
- Store detailed logs for analysis

**Technical Approach**:
```javascript
// Wrap native URL constructor to intercept all calls
// Log detailed error information with stack traces
// Capture DOM context and element references
// Store data in sessionStorage for analysis
// Provide real-time console logging with filters
```

### 2. DOM Monitoring Component

**Purpose**: Track dynamic DOM changes that might create invalid URLs.

**Monitoring Points**:
- Image `src` attribute changes
- Form `action` attribute updates  
- Anchor `href` modifications
- Dynamic script injections
- AJAX response processing

### 3. Event Listener Integration

**Purpose**: Hook into key Shopify and theme events that commonly trigger URL construction.

**Events to Monitor**:
- Variant selection changes
- Cart updates
- Product image swaps
- Analytics tracking calls
- Third-party app integrations

### 4. Data Collection & Analysis System

**Purpose**: Aggregate error data for pattern identification.

**Data Points Collected**:
- Exact invalid URL value
- Complete stack trace
- Page URL and timestamp
- DOM element context
- User agent and device info
- Previous valid URLs (for context)

### 5. Real-time Debugging Interface

**Purpose**: Provide immediate feedback for debugging.

**Features**:
- Console logging with severity levels
- On-page notification system
- Filter by error type or source
- Export functionality for analysis

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Monitoring (Priority: Critical)
1. **Create `assets/url-error-monitor.js`**
   - Implement URL constructor wrapper
   - Add stack trace capture
   - Set up error logging system
   - Create data storage mechanism

2. **Create DOM observer system**
   - Monitor attribute changes on images, forms, links
   - Track dynamic content injection
   - Log DOM context for invalid URLs

3. **Integrate with theme loading**
   - Add script to `layout/theme.liquid`
   - Ensure it loads before other scripts
   - Configure for production use

### Phase 2: Enhanced Detection (Priority: High)
1. **Event listener integration**
   - Hook into Shopify theme events
   - Monitor third-party script loading
   - Track analytics calls

2. **Pattern analysis system**
   - Identify common error patterns
   - Create automated categorization
   - Generate actionable reports

### Phase 3: Debugging Interface (Priority: Medium)
1. **Real-time debugging UI**
   - Console filtering and display
   - On-page error notifications
   - Export functionality

2. **Testing framework**
   - Create test cases for common scenarios
   - Validate monitoring accuracy
   - Performance impact assessment

## Technical Requirements

### Browser Compatibility
- Support Safari 14+ (mobile focus)
- Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Edge 90+
- Ensure ES5 fallback for older browsers

### Performance Considerations
- Minimal overhead on URL construction
- Efficient DOM observation
- Throttled logging to prevent spam
- Memory management for long sessions

### Data Storage
- Use sessionStorage for temporary data
- Implement rotation for large datasets
- Provide export mechanism
- Clear storage on page unload

## Integration Points

### Theme Integration
- Add to `layout/theme.liquid` in `<head>` section
- Load before other scripts to capture all URL constructions
- Configure via theme settings if needed

### Shopify Events
- Hook into `shopify:section:load` events
- Monitor variant selection events
- Track cart update callbacks

### Third-party Compatibility
- Monitor KondaSoft component loading
- Track analytics script injections
- Handle app-generated URL constructions

## Expected Outputs

### Immediate Results
- Real-time error logging in console
- Identification of error sources within 24 hours
- Pattern recognition for common failures

### Analysis Reports
- Categorized error types with frequencies
- Stack trace analysis showing exact sources
- DOM element identification for fixes
- Performance impact measurements

### Actionable Fixes
- Specific file and line number locations
- Recommended code changes
- Priority ranking of issues
- Prevention strategies

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Impact
- Benchmark URL construction overhead
- Implement throttling for high-frequency calls
- Monitor memory usage during testing

### False Positives
- Filter out expected/harmless invalid URLs
- Distinguish between test scenarios and real errors
- Validate against known Shopify patterns

### Production Deployment
- Start with staging environment testing
- Implement feature flags for easy disable
- Monitor for unexpected side effects

## Success Criteria

1. **Complete Error Source Identification**: Know exactly which code/component is generating invalid URLs
2. **Actionable Fix Locations**: Specific files and line numbers for corrections
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Understanding of common failure modes
4. **Performance Validation**: Minimal impact on site performance
5. **Production Ready**: Stable monitoring that can run continuously

## Timeline

- **Day 1**: Core monitoring script implementation
- **Day 2**: DOM observer and integration testing
- **Day 3**: Production deployment and initial data collection
- **Day 4-7**: Data analysis and pattern identification
- **Day 8**: Actionable fix recommendations

## Dependencies

- Access to Shopify theme files
- Ability to modify `layout/theme.liquid`
- Testing environment for validation
- Console access for debugging

## Notes

- This monitoring system is temporary for debugging purposes
- Should be removed after identifying and fixing root causes
- Data collection must respect user privacy
- Monitor for any negative impact on site performance

## Expected Resolution

Once implemented, this monitoring system should identify the exact source of the invalid URL errors within 24-48 hours of deployment, providing specific locations and actionable fix recommendations to resolve the Shopify analytics errors permanently.

# Shopify Employee Dashboard Implementation Plan
## Created: 2025-08-16

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a simple, elegant employee dashboard for accessing customer pet images through Shopify App Proxy authentication. The solution leverages existing infrastructure while maintaining the current customer experience (70% mobile usage) with no disruption.

## Key Business Requirements

1. **Zero Customer Disruption**: Current localStorage + order properties flow continues unchanged
2. **Mobile-First Employee Access**: Dashboard optimized for 70% mobile usage by fulfillment staff
3. **Simple Authentication**: Use Shopify App Proxy (simplest approach) for employee access
4. **Cost Effective**: Minimal infrastructure additions (<$100/month)
5. **Data Linking**: Connect order numbers to customer uploaded images seamlessly

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing Components (Already Built)
- ✅ **Customer Storage Manager**: `backend/inspirenet-api/src/customer_storage.py` with GCS lifecycle management
- ✅ **Fulfillment Database**: `backend/pet-fulfillment-webhook.py` with SQLite order tracking
- ✅ **Frontend Upload**: `assets/pet-processor-v5-es5.js` with localStorage fallback
- ✅ **Order Integration**: Pet data flows through Shopify order properties (255 char limit)

### Missing Components (Need Implementation)
- ❌ **Order-Image Linking**: Connect Shopify orders to cloud storage sessions
- ❌ **Employee Dashboard UI**: Mobile-first interface for image access
- ❌ **Shopify App Proxy**: Authentication and routing setup
- ❌ **Upload Bridge**: Auto-sync localStorage to cloud storage on order creation

## Recommended Implementation Approach

### 1. Shopify App Proxy Setup (Simplest Method)

**Approach**: Private App with App Proxy (NOT full Shopify App)

**Why This is Optimal**:
- Leverages existing Shopify admin authentication
- No OAuth complexity or user management
- Existing domain and infrastructure
- HMAC signature verification built-in
- 5-minute setup vs weeks for full app

**Setup Steps**:
1. Create Shopify Private App in admin
2. Configure App Proxy URL: `/apps/pet-fulfillment`
3. Add HMAC verification middleware
4. Route requests to existing Cloud Run service

**Security**: Shopify handles all authentication, we just verify HMAC signatures

### 2. Order-to-Image Linking Strategy

**Current Flow**:
```
Customer Upload → localStorage → Order Properties → Manual Fulfillment
```

**Enhanced Flow** (Backward Compatible):
```
Customer Upload → localStorage + Cloud Storage → Order Properties + Session ID → Dashboard Access
```

**Implementation**:
- Enhance `customer_storage.py` with `link_order_to_session(order_number, session_id)` method
- Modify `pet-fulfillment-webhook.py` to extract session_id from order properties and link storage
- Add background upload in `pet-processor-v5-es5.js` (localStorage remains primary for offline)

### 3. Webhook Configuration

**Existing Webhook**: Already handles order data in `pet-fulfillment-webhook.py`

**Enhancement Needed**:
```python
@app.route('/webhooks/shopify/orders/create', methods=['POST'])
def handle_shopify_order_webhook():
    """New webhook for Shopify order creation"""
    # Extract session_id from order line item properties
    # Call customer_storage.move_to_tier(session_id, 'temporary', 'order_pending')
    # Link order_number to session_id in database
```

**Webhook URL**: `https://your-api.run.app/webhooks/shopify/orders/create`

### 4. Mobile-First Dashboard Interface

**Technology Choice**: Server-side rendered HTML with minimal JavaScript
- **Why**: 70% mobile usage requires fast loading, minimal bandwidth
- **Framework**: Flask/Jinja2 templates (already in webhook service)
- **Performance Target**: <2.5 seconds load time on mobile

**Interface Design**:
```
/apps/pet-fulfillment/
├── orders/                 # Order list (pending, in-progress, completed)
├── orders/{order_number}/  # Order detail with image gallery
└── images/{session_id}/    # Direct image access with zoom
```

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Enhancement (Week 1)

#### Task 1.1: Enhance Customer Storage for Order Linking
**File**: `backend/inspirenet-api/src/customer_storage.py`

**New Methods to Add**:
```python
async def link_order_to_session(self, order_number: str, session_id: str) -> bool:
    """Link Shopify order to storage session"""
    
async def get_images_by_order(self, order_number: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Get all images for a Shopify order number"""
    
async def move_session_to_order_pending(self, session_id: str, order_number: str) -> bool:
    """Move session from temporary to order_pending tier with order linking"""
```

#### Task 1.2: Create Upload Bridge in Frontend
**File**: `assets/pet-processor-v5-es5.js`

**Enhancement**:
```javascript
// Add after successful image processing
async function uploadToCloudStorage(imageData, imageType) {
    // Background upload to /api/v2/upload-session-image
    // Keep localStorage as primary (no disruption)
    // Add session_id to order properties for linking
}
```

#### Task 1.3: Enhanced Webhook Handler
**File**: `backend/pet-fulfillment-webhook.py`

**New Endpoint**:
```python
@app.route('/webhooks/shopify/orders/create', methods=['POST'])
def handle_shopify_order_webhook():
    # Verify Shopify webhook signature
    # Extract session_id from order line_items properties
    # Link order to cloud storage session
    # Move images from temporary to order_pending tier
```

### Phase 2: Dashboard Development (Week 2)

#### Task 2.1: Shopify App Proxy Setup
**New File**: `backend/inspirenet-api/src/shopify_proxy.py`

**Key Components**:

- `POST /apps/pet-fulfillment/orders/{order_number}/download` - Download tracking
- `PUT /apps/pet-fulfillment/orders/{order_number}/status` - Status updates

#### Task 2.3: Mobile-First HTML Templates
**New Directory**: `backend/dashboard/templates/`

**Templates**:
- `base.html` - Mobile-first responsive layout
- `order_list.html` - Touch-optimized order cards
- `order_detail.html` - Image gallery with zoom
- `image_viewer.html` - Full-screen image viewer

### Phase 3: Integration & Authentication (Week 3)

#### Task 3.1: Shopify Private App Configuration
**Setup Steps**:
1. Shopify Admin → Apps → Develop apps → Create app
2. App Proxy URL: `https://your-api.run.app/apps/pet-fulfillment`
3. Subpath: `pet-fulfillment`
4. Generate webhook endpoint and shared secret

#### Task 3.2: Order Properties Enhancement
**File**: `snippets/buy-buttons.liquid` (or similar cart integration)

**Enhancement**:
```liquid
<!-- Add session_id to order properties for cloud storage linking -->
<input type="hidden" name="properties[_pet_session_id]" value="{{ pet_session_id }}">
<input type="hidden" name="properties[_pet_upload_status]" value="cloud_synced">
```

#### Task 3.3: Production Deployment

## Shopify-Specific Optimizations

### 1. Order Properties Best Practices
- Use `_pet_session_id` (underscore prefix hides from customer)
- Limit to essential data due to 255 character constraint
- Include upload status for troubleshooting

### 2. Webhook Reliability
- Implement idempotency keys to handle duplicate webhooks
- Use retry logic with exponential backoff
- Store webhook processing status for debugging

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Cache order data for 24 hours to reduce Shopify API calls
- Use CDN for serving processed images
- Implement image thumbnails for gallery view
- Progressive loading for mobile networks

### 4. Security Considerations
- All dashboard routes require valid Shopify HMAC signature
- Images stored with unguessable URLs (UUID-based paths)
- Audit logging for all employee dashboard actions
- Automatic session cleanup after order fulfillment

## Shopify-Specific Gotchas & Solutions

### 1. **App Proxy Caching Issue**
**Problem**: Shopify may cache App Proxy responses
**Solution**: Add cache-busting headers and timestamp parameters

### 2. **Order Properties Character Limit**
**Problem**: 255 character limit for line item properties
**Solution**: Use compact session IDs and minimal metadata

### 3. **Webhook Retry Behavior**
**Problem**: Shopify retries failed webhooks aggressively
**Solution**: Return 200 OK immediately, process asynchronously

### 4. **Mobile Admin Interface**
**Problem**: Shopify admin is mobile-friendly but App Proxy content needs optimization
**Solution**: Server-side rendering with mobile-first CSS, minimal JavaScript

### 5. **Authentication Scope**
**Problem**: App Proxy inherits Shopify admin permissions
**Solution**: Add role-based access control within dashboard if needed

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Option A: Full Shopify App (Rejected)
**Pros**: More flexible, better branding
**Cons**: Complex OAuth, app store approval, higher cost, longer development

### Option B: Standalone Dashboard with Shopify API (Rejected)
**Pros**: Complete control over UI/UX
**Cons**: Custom authentication, API rate limits, higher complexity

### Option C: Shopify Admin Action Extension (Rejected)
**Pros**: Native Shopify integration
**Cons**: Limited UI flexibility, newer/less stable API

**Selected: App Proxy** - Perfect balance of simplicity, functionality, and development speed

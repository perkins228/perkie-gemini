        hasTransformation: true,
        date: new Date().toISOString(),
        productId: window.currentProductId || null
    };
    localStorage.setItem('petTransformationForReview', JSON.stringify(petTransformation));
    
    // Show review prompt after 2 seconds
    setTimeout(function() {
        var reviewPrompt = document.createElement('div');
        reviewPrompt.className = 'transformation-review-prompt';
        reviewPrompt.innerHTML = 
            '<div style="position: fixed; bottom: 20px; right: 20px; background: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15); z-index: 999; max-width: 300px;">' +

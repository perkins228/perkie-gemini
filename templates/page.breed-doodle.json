            "style_description": "Color is the go-to style for doodles. The warm apricots, the rich chocolates, the creamy whites, the complex parti and merle patterns. Color captures the coat that makes your doodle uniquely yours. Especially stunning for red Goldendoodles and tricolor Bernedoodles where the color variation is part of their identity.",

            "style_tag": "Made for the Floof",
            "style_description": "Ink wash and curly coats are a perfect match. The flowing, painterly brushstrokes mirror the natural movement of a doodle's curls in a way that feels almost organic. The result looks like a hand-painted watercolor of your dog. If your doodle has a wavy or loosely curled coat, ink wash captures that texture beautifully. A top recommendation for goldendoodle portraits.",

            "style_description": "Black and white turns a doodle's coat texture into the star of the portrait. Without color, every curl and wave becomes a study in light and shadow. The result is surprisingly sophisticated for a breed that spends most of its time being silly. The top choice for doodle memorial portraits and large framed prints, where the classic, dignified feel creates a lasting tribute.",

            "tip_description": "This is the single most important tip for doodle portraits. If your doodle's face fur is covering their eyes in the photo, the portrait will look like a ball of fur without a face. Brush the hair back, wait until after a grooming appointment, or catch a moment where the wind or head angle reveals their eyes."

            "tip_description": "Both looks work, but they create very different portraits. A freshly groomed doodle with a short face cut produces a cleaner, more structured portrait. A shaggy, grown-out doodle creates a softer, fluffier portrait with more texture and character. Neither is better. Just know that whichever version you photograph is the version you'll get."

            "tip_title": "Natural light makes curly coats shine",
            "tip_description": "A doodle's curly coat catches and reflects light in complex ways. Natural outdoor light, especially soft light on a cloudy day or during golden hour, brings out every curl and wave. Indoor flash tends to create hot spots on the lighter curls while losing detail in the shadows between them."

            "tip_description": "Doodles have round, symmetrical faces that look best photographed from the front or at a slight angle. Side profiles can get lost in the coat volume. A straight-on shot with the ears framing the face captures the classic teddy bear look that doodle owners love. Get down to their eye level for the most natural perspective."

This is also the style that does the most justice to cat eyes, preserving the vivid greens, golds, and blues that make them so mesmerizing. The most popular choice for cat portraits by a wide margin.",

            "style_description": "Cats have a natural intensity that Black & White amplifies. The sharp facial geometry, the whiskers, the piercing gaze. Without color, these elements become the entire portrait. Especially dramatic for tuxedo cats and black cats, where the monochrome style plays with their natural coloring. The top choice for cat memorial portraits, where the classic, dignified feel creates a lasting tribute.",

The soft brushstrokes are particularly beautiful for long-haired breeds like Maine Coons and Persians, where the flowing fur translates naturally into the flowing paint style. Creates an artistic, almost dreamy quality that matches a cat's mysterious personality.",

The soft, directional light creates gentle shadows that reveal facial detail and makes cat eyes glow. Avoid flash photography with cats entirely. It flattens the facial features and turns their beautiful eyes into flat, reflective discs."

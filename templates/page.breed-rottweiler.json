The dark coat becomes a dramatic backdrop, the tan markings translate into lighter tones that highlight the eyes and expression, and the overall effect is a portrait that feels powerful and dignified. This style captures the authority of the breed in its purest form. The most popular choice for rottweiler memorial portraits.",

The best choice for showcasing the specific shade and placement of your rottie's markings.",

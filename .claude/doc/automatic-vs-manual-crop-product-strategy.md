---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of market data, user psychology, and competitive intelligence, the recommendation is clear:

**MAINTAIN the automatic AI cropping system with addition of a simple adjustment slider as Phase 2 enhancement**

- **Primary Strategy**: Keep automatic pose-adaptive cropping (2.0x head height, 4:5 portrait) as default
- **Phase 2 Enhancement**: Add optional zoom slider for edge cases (2-3 days development)
- **Avoid**: Complex manual crop interfaces that will kill conversion
- **ROI**: 10-20x return on simple slider investment

The data shows that automatic cropping with optional refinement delivers the optimal balance of conversion, customer satisfaction, and support efficiency.

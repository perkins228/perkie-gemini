# Debug Consultation Request - Pet Deletion Verification Failure

**Session Context**: .claude/tasks/context_session_1724345999000.md

## Issue Summary

Console error showing verification failure after pet deletion attempt:
```
🚨 DELETE VERIFICATION FAILED - Pet card still exists: 1
(anonymous)    @    custom-pet-t-shirt?_…m&_ss1.0:4351
setTimeout        
window.deletePet    @    custom-pet-t-shirt?_…m&_ss=e&_v=1.0:4321
```

## Context
- Error occurs in pet selector on product pages
- Verification check runs via setTimeout after deletion attempt
- Pet card still exists when it should be removed
- Lines involved: 4351 (verification), 4321 (deletePet function)

## Code Location
The pet selector is in `snippets/ks-product-pet-selector.liquid` with:
- Deletion logic in `window.deletePet` function (lines ~1368-1568)
- Verification check around line 1552-1556 in the setTimeout chain

## Key Code Analysis Points

### 1. Deletion Process (lines 1368-1568)
```javascript
window.deletePet = function(sessionKey) {
  if (confirm('Remove this pet from your collection?')) {
    console.log('🗑️ Starting deletion for pet:', sessionKey);
    
    // Multiple deletion steps:
    // 1. Remove from window.perkieEffects
    // 2. Remove from localStorage
    // 3. Update session data
    // 4. Update backups
    // 5. UI refresh via setTimeout
    
    setTimeout(function() {
      // UI refresh logic
      loadSavedPets();
      
      // Verification check (THIS IS FAILING)
      setTimeout(function() {
        var remainingPetCards = document.querySelectorAll('[data-delete-key="' + sessionKey + '"]');
        if (remainingPetCards.length > 0) {
          console.error('🚨 DELETE VERIFICATION FAILED - Pet card still exists:', remainingPetCards.length);
        }
      }, 500);
    }, 200);
  }
};
```

### 2. UI Refresh Process
The deletion triggers `loadSavedPets()` which:
- Checks `window.perkieEffects` for pet data
- Calls `extractPetDataFromCache()` to get pets
- Renders pets via `renderPets()`
- Creates new DOM elements with `data-delete-key` attributes

## Questions for Debug Analysis

1. **Root Cause Possibilities**: What are the most likely reasons the verification would still find pet cards after deletion?

2. **Race Conditions**: Are there timing issues between data deletion, UI refresh, and verification that could cause this?

3. **Data Recovery**: Could the `restoreEffectsFromLocalStorage()` or backup recovery logic be re-adding the deleted pet during UI refresh?

4. **DOM State**: Could there be multiple pet selector instances or stale DOM elements causing the verification to find old cards?

5. **Session Data**: Could incomplete session data cleanup be causing the pet to be re-rendered from localStorage?

## Debugging Recommendations Needed

Please provide:
1. Systematic approach to isolate the root cause
2. Specific logging points to add for debugging
3. Potential race condition scenarios to check
4. Fix strategies for each likely root cause

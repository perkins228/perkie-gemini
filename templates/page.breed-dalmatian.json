The spots become bold graphic elements, and the face and expression emerge from the pattern with striking clarity. This is the style that makes people stop and stare. The most popular choice for dalmatian owners and dalmatian memorial portraits.",

Color portraits feel warmer and more lifelike, and they capture the individual spot pattern with photographic detail. The best choice for liver-spotted dalmatians where the brown spots deserve their full warm tone.",

            "style_description": "This is the signature Westie portrait style. The white coat translates into rich gray tones that show every bit of coat texture, while the dark eyes and nose become bold focal points. The result is a portrait with striking contrast and elegant simplicity. Black & White Westie portraits have a timeless quality that makes them feel like they belong in a gallery. The top choice for Westie memorial portraits.",

            "style_description": "The all-white coat gives Ink Wash room to shine. Without competing coat colors, every contour is visible and contributes to the artistic quality of the portrait. The result is soft, painterly, and beautifully textured. Particularly stunning because the Westie's coat provides just enough warmth and variation for the style to work with.",

Add the dark eyes, the black nose, and the occasional pink tongue, and a Color Westie portrait has more visual variety than you'd expect. The best choice for capturing your Westie exactly as they look.",

A tiny highlight in each eye makes the portrait feel alive. Without visible eye detail, a Westie portrait loses its soul."

If you're photographing your Westie indoors, position them against a darker surface or background so the coat edges are clearly defined. Outdoors, grass or earth tones work naturally. Don't worry about the background in the final portrait (we handle that), but the photo needs to clearly show where the dog ends and the surroundings begin."

            "tip_description": "Westies have a rough, double coat with real texture. Soft natural light, especially slightly directional light from a window, creates subtle shadows in the coat that give the portrait depth. Flash or flat overhead lighting makes the white coat look like a solid, featureless mass."

A scruffier look works too and has its own charm, but if you want the classic, polished Westie portrait, time your photo for soon after a grooming session."

            "style_description": "This is the definitive husky portrait style. Black and white transforms the facial mask, the coat contrast, and those legendary eyes into something that looks like fine art. The graphic quality of a husky's markings becomes even more dramatic without color. If your husky has blue eyes, the intensity comes through even in monochrome. The most requested style for this breed by a wide margin, and the top choice for husky memorial portraits.",

            "style_description": "Color is essential if you want the full impact of your husky's eye color. Blue, amber, bi-colored. Color preserves what makes husky eyes legendary. It also captures the red, agouti, and gray coat variations that distinguish individual huskies. The best choice when the eye color is a defining feature you can't lose.",

The flowing brushstroke style captures the thick coat and wolf-like features in a way that feels elemental and natural. The result looks like a portrait painted during an expedition. Beautiful for huskies whose personality leans more wild than domestic.",

This style captures the intense, electric energy of a breed that was built to run and never stop. Especially striking for red huskies.",

A photo where the eyes catch a little light and show depth produces a dramatically better portrait than one where the eyes are in shadow. If your husky has heterochromia (two different colored eyes), angle the photo so both eyes are clearly visible."

            "tip_description": "Huskies love snow, but bright white snow creates extreme contrast that can blow out the white fur and underexpose the face. Overcast days in snow are fine. Bright sunny snow days make it nearly impossible to get good facial detail. Save the snow photos for Instagram and take the portrait photo in softer lighting."

            "tip_description": "The facial mask is what makes a husky instantly recognizable. Make sure the lighting reveals the mask pattern clearly: the contrast between the dark and light areas around the eyes and forehead. Flat or dim lighting can muddy these markings and lose the visual impact."

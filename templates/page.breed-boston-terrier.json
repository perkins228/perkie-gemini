            "style_description": "Boston terriers are already dressed in black and white. A Black & White portrait takes what nature started and elevates it into fine art. The high-contrast markings become even more dramatic, the round eyes become the undeniable focal point, and the result is graphic, elegant, and striking. This is the style that feels like it was invented for Boston terriers, and the top choice for Boston terrier memorial portraits.",

            "style_description": "Color reveals what black and white hides: the warm brown undertones of a seal coat, the subtle brindle pattern, the pink of the tongue, the depth in those dark eyes. Color portraits feel warmer and more lifelike, and they're the best choice for brindle Bostons where the tiger-stripe pattern deserves to be seen.",

            "style_description": "Marker takes the Boston terrier's graphic quality and amplifies it. The bold lines and vivid colors turn the tuxedo markings into a pop-art statement piece. This style captures the playful, goofy side of the breed that the \"gentleman\" nickname understates. Fun, eye-catching, and full of personality.",

The flowing brushstroke style blends the hard edges between dark and light into something gentler and more painterly. A beautiful choice for senior Bostons and memorial portraits where warmth matters more than graphic impact.",

            "tip_description": "The high contrast between the dark coat and white markings can fool phone cameras into overexposing the white areas. If the white blaze and chest look like featureless bright patches in your photo, the portrait will lose detail there too. Soft, even lighting keeps both the dark and light areas well-exposed. Tap on the white area of the face to adjust exposure if your phone allows it."

            "tip_description": "Boston terrier eyes are large, round, and incredibly expressive. They're the star of the portrait. Make sure they're well-lit with a visible highlight. A photo where the eyes catch a little natural light and show depth produces a portrait that feels alive."

            "tip_description": "The erect, pointed ears are a key part of the Boston terrier silhouette. Make sure they're fully visible in the frame. If one ear is cropped off or folded back, the portrait loses a defining feature. Both ears up and forward is the ideal."

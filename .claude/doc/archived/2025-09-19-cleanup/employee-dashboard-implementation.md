# Employee Dashboard Implementation Plan
## Created: 2025-08-16

## Business Objective
Create a simple, elegant backend dashboard for Shopify store employees to access customer pet image data during order fulfillment. The dashboard must provide quick access to original uploads, processed images, pet names, and artist notes.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. **Data Access Architecture**
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Employees can view all customer-uploaded images (original + processed) for a given order
- Artist notes and pet names are clearly displayed
- System works with existing localStorage/Shopify order properties limitation
- No customer data is lost during the transition

### 2. **Authentication & Security**
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Only authorized employees can access the dashboard
- Customer data is protected and not publicly accessible
- Complies with data privacy requirements
- Integration with Shopify admin authentication

### 3. **Order-to-Image Linking**
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard can retrieve images based on Shopify order number
- Session IDs in order properties correctly map to stored images
- Handles cases where images might be in localStorage OR cloud storage

### 4. **Mobile-First Interface**
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard works seamlessly on mobile devices (70% of usage)
- Fast loading times on mobile networks
- Touch-friendly interface for order fulfillment staff

### 5. **Data Migration Strategy**
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Customer images move from localStorage to persistent storage
- No disruption to current customer experience
- Automatic cleanup of old/fulfilled order data

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Storage Infrastructure Enhancement
**Goal:** Establish persistent storage for customer images

- **Task 1.1: Enhance Customer Storage Integration**
  - Modify `backend/inspirenet-api/src/customer_storage.py` to add order linking capabilities
  - Add endpoint to associate session_id with Shopify order_number
  - Implement retrieval by order_number
  → **Agent:** code-refactoring-master

- **Task 1.2: Create Upload Bridge from Frontend**
  - Modify `assets/pet-processor-v5-es5.js` to automatically upload processed images to backend
  - Keep localStorage as fallback for offline/error scenarios
  - Add background upload queue for reliability
  → **Agent:** mobile-commerce-architect

- **Task 1.3: Update Order Properties Integration**
  - Modify `snippets/buy-buttons.liquid` to include cloud storage URLs when available
  - Add `_storage_session_id` property for cloud retrieval
  - Keep existing properties for backward compatibility
  → **Agent:** shopify-conversion-optimizer

### Phase 2: Dashboard Application Development
**Goal:** Create employee-facing dashboard interface

- **Task 2.1: Dashboard Architecture Decision**
  - Option A: Shopify App Proxy (Recommended)
    - Create Flask/FastAPI app hosted on same infrastructure
    - Use Shopify App Proxy for authentication
    - Path: `/apps/pet-fulfillment/*`
  - Option B: Standalone with Shopify OAuth
    - Separate subdomain with Shopify OAuth
    - More complex but more flexible
  → **Agent:** infrastructure-reliability-engineer

- **Task 2.2: Create Dashboard API Endpoints**
  - New file: `backend/inspirenet-api/src/fulfillment_dashboard.py`
  - Endpoints:
    - `GET /fulfillment/order/{order_number}` - Get all pet data for order
    - `GET /fulfillment/image/{session_id}/{image_type}` - Get specific image
    - `POST /fulfillment/order/{order_number}/status` - Update fulfillment status
    - `GET /fulfillment/orders/pending` - List pending fulfillments
  → **Agent:** ai-product-manager-ecommerce

- **Task 2.3: Create Dashboard Frontend**
  - New file: `backend/dashboard/templates/fulfillment.html`
  - Mobile-first responsive design
  - Features:
    - Order search by number
    - Image gallery with zoom
    - Artist notes display
    - Download all images as ZIP
    - Mark as fulfilled
  → **Agent:** ux-design-ecommerce-expert

### Phase 3: Shopify Integration
**Goal:** Connect dashboard with Shopify order system

- **Task 3.1: Webhook Handler Enhancement**
  - Modify `backend/pet-fulfillment-webhook.py` to:
    - Listen for `orders/create` webhook
    - Extract session_id from order properties
    - Move images from temporary to order_pending tier
    - Store order metadata in database
  → **Agent:** shopify-conversion-optimizer

- **Task 3.2: Authentication Layer**
  - Implement Shopify App Proxy verification
  - Add middleware to verify HMAC signatures
  - Store employee access logs
  → **Agent:** infrastructure-reliability-engineer

- **Task 3.3: Order Status Sync**
  - Create background job to sync fulfillment status
  - Update Shopify order notes when images are downloaded
  - Send notifications when orders are ready for production
  → **Agent:** growth-engineer-marktech

### Phase 4: Data Migration & Testing
**Goal:** Safely migrate to new system

- **Task 4.1: Migration Script**
  - Create one-time script to upload existing localStorage data
  - Run on order confirmation page
  - Delete localStorage after successful upload
  → **Agent:** debug-specialist

- **Task 4.2: Testing Suite**
  - Create `testing/dashboard-integration-test.html`
  - Test order flow from upload to fulfillment
  - Verify mobile responsiveness
  → **Agent:** code-quality-reviewer

- **Task 4.3: Monitoring & Alerts**
  - Add metrics for upload success rate
  - Monitor dashboard response times
  - Alert on storage quota approaching limits
  → **Agent:** infrastructure-reliability-engineer

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Storage:** Use existing Google Cloud Storage bucket with lifecycle policies
- **Database:** SQLite for order metadata (already in pet-fulfillment-webhook.py)
- **Authentication:** Shopify App Proxy for simplest integration
- **Frontend:** Server-side rendered HTML with minimal JavaScript for speed
- **Image Processing:** Keep existing InSPyReNet API, add linking layer

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement image thumbnail generation for dashboard gallery
- Use CDN for serving processed images
- Cache order data for 24 hours after fulfillment
- Implement progressive image loading on mobile

### Security Measures
- All dashboard routes require Shopify authentication
- Images stored with unguessable URLs (UUID-based)
- Automatic purging of images after 180 days (completed orders)
- Audit logging for all dashboard actions

### Integration Points
- Shopify Webhooks: orders/create, orders/fulfilled
- Existing pet-processor-v5-es5.js upload flow
- Current order property system (backward compatible)
- InSPyReNet API for processing

## Success Metrics

1. **Operational Efficiency**
   - Time to retrieve order images: < 3 seconds
   - Employee satisfaction score: > 4/5
   - Order fulfillment time reduction: > 20%

2. **Technical Performance**
   - Image upload success rate: > 99%
   - Dashboard availability: > 99.9%
   - Mobile page load time: < 2 seconds

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Zero customer image loss during migration
   - 100% order-to-image mapping accuracy
   - Successful retrieval rate: > 99.9%

4. **Cost Efficiency**
   - Storage costs within $100/month budget
   - Minimal additional infrastructure required
   - Automatic cleanup reducing storage waste

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1:** Phase 1 - Storage Infrastructure (Tasks 1.1-1.3)
- **Week 2:** Phase 2 - Dashboard Development (Tasks 2.1-2.3)
- **Week 3:** Phase 3 - Shopify Integration (Tasks 3.1-3.3)
- **Week 4:** Phase 4 - Migration & Testing (Tasks 4.1-4.3)

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Loss Risk:** Keep localStorage as fallback for 30 days
2. **Performance Risk:** Implement caching and CDN from day one
3. **Security Risk:** Use Shopify's authentication, no custom auth
4. **Migration Risk:** Gradual rollout with feature flags
5. **Cost Risk:** Set up billing alerts at 50% of budget

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve implementation plan
2. Set up development environment for dashboard
3. Create Shopify private app for authentication
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation with storage enhancement
5. Schedule weekly progress reviews

## Notes & Assumptions

- Assumes Shopify Plus or ability to create private apps
- Google Cloud Storage bucket already configured
- Existing InSPyReNet API will remain operational
- Employees have Shopify admin access
- Current order volume allows for manual fulfillment process
- No need for real-time image processing status in dashboard

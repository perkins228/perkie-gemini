## What NOT to Re-apply

### ❌ DO NOT Re-apply These Problematic Commits
1. `6f574ed` - ES6 to ES5 conversion (caused syntax errors)
2. `341fc47` - ES6 standards restoration attempt (incomplete fix)
3. `94a08ec` - JavaScript syntax error fix (partial)
4. `e4b5f65` - Arrow function syntax errors (still had issues)
5. `1ee76e9` - Confusing duplicate file cleanup (may have removed needed files)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Verify Core Functionality (Today)
- [ ] Test pet selector on staging
- [ ] Verify background removal works
- [ ] Confirm product pages load without errors
- [ ] Check console for JavaScript errors

### Phase 2: Cherry-pick Critical Fixes (Tomorrow)
- [ ] White background regression fix
- [ ] Safari Private Mode support
- [ ] Test thoroughly after each cherry-pick

### Phase 3: Rebuild Features Properly (This Week)
- [ ] Social sharing with proper ES5 compatibility
- [ ] Feature flags for legacy code
- [ ] Any other growth features

## Testing Checklist After Recovery

- [ ] Pet upload works
- [ ] Background removal processes
- [ ] All 4 effects generate
- [ ] Pet selector displays pets
- [ ] Pets can be selected for products
- [ ] Add to cart functions
- [ ] No console errors

## Important Notes

1. **Storage consolidation is preserved** - Our biggest win is kept
2. **Social sharing wasn't the problem** - It can be safely re-added
3. **ES5/ES6 mixing was the issue** - Maintain consistency going forward
4. **Test incrementally** - Cherry-pick and test one commit at a time

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Wait for GitHub → Shopify deployment (2-3 minutes)
2. Test staging URL with Playwright MCP
3. Upload IMG_2733.jpeg and Sam.jpg 
4. Verify pet selector horizontal layout
5. Cherry-pick white background fix if needed

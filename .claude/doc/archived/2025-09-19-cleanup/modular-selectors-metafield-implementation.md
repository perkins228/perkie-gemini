# Modular Pet & Font Selectors - Metafield Implementation Guide

## Overview
Simple, flexible control over which customization options appear on each product using Shopify's native metafield system.

## Implementation Complete ✅

### What Changed
Modified `sections/main-product.liquid` to support independent control of pet and font selectors via product metafields.

### Metafields Configuration

#### 1. Pet Selector Control
**Metafield**: `product.metafields.custom.enable_pet_selector`
- **Type**: Boolean
- **Default**: true (shows pet selector for backward compatibility)
- **Set to false**: Hide pet selector on specific products

#### 2. Font Selector Control  
**Metafield**: `product.metafields.custom.supports_font_styles`
- **Type**: Boolean
- **Default**: false (font selector hidden)
- **Set to true**: Show font style options

## Product Configuration Examples

### Scenario 1: Physical Products (Keychains, Phone Cases)
```
enable_pet_selector: true
supports_font_styles: false
```
Result: Shows pet selector only - simpler flow for small text areas

### Scenario 2: Typography Products (T-Shirts, Cards)
```
enable_pet_selector: true
supports_font_styles: true
```
Result: Shows both pet and font selectors

### Scenario 3: Non-Customizable Products
```
enable_pet_selector: false
supports_font_styles: false
```
Result: Neither selector appears

### Scenario 4: Font-Only Products (Future Use)
```
enable_pet_selector: false
supports_font_styles: true
```
Result: Only font selector (edge case)

## How to Configure in Shopify Admin

1. Go to Products in Shopify Admin
2. Select the product to configure
3. Scroll to "Metafields" section
4. Add custom metafields:
   - `custom.enable_pet_selector` (Boolean)
   - `custom.supports_font_styles` (Boolean)
5. Set values based on product requirements
6. Save product

## Benefits of This Approach

### Simplicity ✅
- No new files created
- Uses existing Shopify features
- Backward compatible
- Easy to understand and maintain

### Flexibility ✅
- Per-product control
- Independent module toggling
- A/B testing ready
- No code changes needed for different products

### Performance ✅
- No additional JavaScript
- No complex module loading
- Maintains current performance
- Mobile-optimized (70% traffic)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Product with both selectors works
- [ ] Product with pet selector only works
- [ ] Product with neither selector works
- [ ] Existing products maintain current behavior
- [ ] Mobile experience remains smooth
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Products
- All existing products continue working as before
- Pet selector shows by default (backward compatibility)
- Font selector controlled by existing `supports_font_styles` metafield

### For New Products
- Configure metafields as needed
- Test on staging before production
- Monitor conversion rates

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, simply remove the conditional logic and revert to original code:
```liquid
{%- when 'ks_pet_selector' -%}
  <div class="product__pet-selector" {{ block.shopify_attributes }}>
    {% render 'ks-product-pet-selector', product: product, section: section %}
    {% if product.metafields.custom.supports_font_styles == true %}
      {% render 'pet-font-selector' %}
    {% endif %}
  </div>
```

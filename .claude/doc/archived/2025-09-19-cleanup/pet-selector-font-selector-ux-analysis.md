**Session Context**: .claude/tasks/context_session_2025-09-04.md

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation**: ✅ **Implement selective display logic with product type differentiation**

Showing pet-selector without font customization makes strong UX sense for specific product categories and user scenarios. This strategy should be implemented using product-based logic to optimize conversion rates while reducing decision fatigue.

## 1. Customer Experience Impact Analysis

### Positive Impacts of Selective Font Removal

#### ✅ **Reduced Cognitive Load**

- **Behavior**: Primary focus is pet image quality, not text styling
- **Result**: Faster path to purchase without unnecessary customization steps

#### ✅ **Cleaner Mobile Experience**
- **Space Savings**: ~150-200px vertical space on mobile (significant on small screens)
- **Touch Optimization**: Fewer elements competing for thumb-zone real estate
- **Scroll Reduction**: Less vertical scrolling needed to reach cart actions

### Potential Negative Impacts

#### ⚠️ **Reduced Perceived Customization Value**
- **Risk**: Product may feel "less customizable" compared to full-featured version
- **Mitigation**: Emphasize pet image processing as primary value prop
- **Severity**: Low - pet processing is the main differentiator

#### ⚠️ **Inconsistent Experience Across Products**
- **Risk**: User confusion if some products have fonts, others don't
- **Mitigation**: Clear visual/textual indicators of available customization
- **Severity**: Medium - requires careful implementation

## 2. Product Type Recommendations

### Products That Should Show Pet Selector ONLY (No Fonts)

#### **Physical Products with Limited Text Space**
- **Keychains**: Text too small to matter significantly
- **Phone Cases**: Pet image is primary visual element
- **Small Mugs/Tumblers**: Limited typography space
- **Jewelry Items**: Focus on pet silhouette/image

**UX Rationale**: Font style has minimal visual impact, removing choice reduces friction

#### **Products Where Pet Image is Hero Element**
- **Canvas Prints**: Pet photo quality is everything
- **Photo Frames**: Image-centric products  
- **Blankets/Textiles**: Image dominates design
- **Wall Art**: Pet image is the primary design element

**UX Rationale**: Typography is secondary, streamline to core value proposition

#### **Lower-Price Point Items**
- **Products under $25**: Reduce decision complexity for impulse purchases
- **Gift Items**: Quick purchase decisions, less customization analysis
- **Multi-quantity Orders**: Bulk orders benefit from simplified flow

**UX Rationale**: Match customization complexity to purchase consideration level

### Products That Should Show Both Components

#### **Typography-Heavy Products**
- **T-shirts/Apparel**: Text styling significantly impacts design
- **Large Mugs**: Ample space for text emphasis
- **Posters with Text**: Typography is key design element
- **Greeting Cards**: Font choice affects message delivery

**UX Rationale**: Font style materially impacts product appearance

#### **Premium/Personalized Items**
- **Custom Portraits**: High customization expectation
- **Anniversary/Memorial Items**: Emotional significance warrants full customization
- **High-value Products ($50+)**: Customers expect comprehensive options

**UX Rationale**: Premium positioning supports additional customization steps

## 3. Mobile vs Desktop Considerations

### Mobile-Specific Benefits (70% of traffic)

#### **Thumb Zone Optimization**
- **Current Issue**: Font selector pushes cart button below thumb reach
- **Solution**: Remove font selector = cart button stays in comfortable reach
- **Impact**: Improved one-handed usability

#### **Screen Real Estate Management**
- **Viewport Usage**: Font selector consumes ~20-25% of mobile viewport
- **Alternative Use**: Space can highlight pet image larger or show product details
- **Loading Performance**: Fewer components = faster rendering on slower devices

#### **Touch Target Optimization**
- **Current Challenge**: Multiple small font preview buttons compete for touches
- **Simplification**: Focus touch interactions on primary pet selection
- **Error Reduction**: Fewer accidental taps on font options

### Desktop Experience

#### **Minimal Negative Impact**
- **Space Abundance**: Desktop has ample space for both components
- **Recommendation**: Could show both components on desktop via responsive design
- **Implementation**: CSS media queries to show/hide font selector

#### **Consistency Consideration**
- **Option A**: Match mobile experience (hide fonts on both)
- **Option B**: Show fonts on desktop, hide on mobile
- **Recommendation**: Option A for consistency, Option B for optimization

## 4. Conversion Impact Assessment

### Positive Conversion Factors

#### **Reduced Abandonment Points**
- **Current Risk**: Additional decision point creates exit opportunity
- **Improvement**: Fewer steps = lower abandonment probability

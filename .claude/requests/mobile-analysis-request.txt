Context: .claude/tasks/context_session_1736096953.md
UX Analysis: .claude/doc/return-to-product-ux-analysis.md

Question: Mobile-specific impact of return-to-product-page functionality

Key Stats:
- 70% of orders are mobile
- Current flow forces mobile users to navigate collections after processing
- Processing takes 30-60s (cold start awareness needed)

Analysis Needed:
1. Mobile abandonment risk at navigation step (quantify)
2. Touch interaction analysis (tap count reduction)
3. Mobile back button behavior expectations
4. App switching/session restoration implications
5. Mobile-specific conversion lift estimate
6. Implementation risks for mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

Deliverable: Append mobile-specific findings to session context with recommendation

## Test Summary

### ❌ Timer Fix NOT Deployed to Preview Site

The timer accuracy fix we implemented locally is **NOT deployed** on the Shopify preview site. The timer still shows the OLD behavior with significant underestimation.

## Test Data

### What Timer Displayed
- **Initial display**: "⏱️ 8 seconds remaining" 
- **Progress messages**: Standard warm-start messages
- **No two-phase messaging**: Did not show AI server startup phase

### Actual Performance Measurements
From network performance data:
1. **Warming call**: `/warmup` - 803.9ms (already warm!)
2. **Processing call**: `/api/v2/process-with-effects` - 2938.9ms (~3 seconds)
3. **Total time**: ~3.8 seconds (warm start)

### Expected vs Actual

| Scenario | What We Fixed (Local) | What's Live (Preview) | Actual Time |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Warm Start | 7 seconds | 8 seconds displayed | 3.8 seconds |
| Cold Start | 85 seconds (60s warming + 25s) | Unknown (not tested) | Unknown |

## Key Findings

### 1. Fix Not Deployed
The timer accuracy fix showing 85 seconds for cold starts is **NOT deployed** to the preview site. The site is still running the old code that shows 8-25 seconds.

### 2. API Was Already Warm
- The `/warmup` endpoint took only 803ms (not 60 seconds)
- This indicates the API was already warm from recent activity
- Processing took ~3 seconds, which is expected for warm starts

### 3. Timer Still Shows Old Behavior
- Timer showed "8 seconds remaining" for a warm start
- This matches the OLD code behavior (not our 85-second fix)
- No two-phase progress messages were displayed

## Deployment Status

### What's Actually Live
The preview site is running the **OLD timer code**:
- Shows 8-25 seconds for processing
- No two-phase progress stages
- No warming phase messaging
- Same underestimation issue we were trying to fix

### What Needs to Deploy
Our local changes that need to be pushed:
1. Timer showing 85 seconds for cold starts
2. Two-phase progress stages (warming + processing)
3. Phase-aware countdown display
4. Increased time cap to 120 seconds

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy the Fix
The timer accuracy fix needs to be deployed to staging:
```bash
git push origin staging
```

### 2. Test Cold Start After Deployment
Once deployed, we need to test a TRUE cold start scenario:
- Wait for API to go cold (15+ minutes of inactivity)
- Upload an image and verify timer shows 85 seconds
- Monitor actual processing time vs displayed estimate

### 3. Verify Two-Phase Messaging
After deployment, confirm:
- Phase 1: "Starting AI servers" (0-60s)
- Phase 2: "Processing your pet" (60-85s)
- Accurate countdown throughout

## Conclusion

The timer accuracy fix has been successfully implemented locally but is **NOT yet deployed** to the Shopify preview site. The site is still showing the problematic behavior where it displays 8-25 seconds when actual cold start processing takes 75-85 seconds.

To resolve this issue:
1. Push the staging branch to deploy our fixes
2. Test with a true cold start scenario
3. Verify the two-phase timer system works correctly

## Charcoal Realism Style Update - 2025-10-24 04:19

### Change Request
User requested that Charcoal Realism style be corrected to match authentic charcoal drawing techniques - hand-drawn appearance with rich charcoal textures, strictly black and white (no color).

### Root Cause of Original Prompt
Initial prompt incorrectly described the style as "moody, gallery-style black and white with soft shadows" - this was photography-based, not charcoal drawing technique.

### Correct Definition Applied
**Charcoal realism** is a drawing style that uses charcoal to create a lifelike image by focusing on value, texture, and detail, rather than lines. It involves:
- Using a range of charcoal types (soft vine charcoal for mid-tones, compressed charcoal for deep blacks)
- Rendering subjects accurately by building up tones and blending them for smooth transitions
- Using tools like stumps and erasers to blend, lift, and add highlights
- Creating realistic sense of depth and form through value alone

### Updated Prompt (Lines 49-65)
**File**: `backend/gemini-artistic-api/src/core/gemini_client.py`

**New Charcoal Realism characteristics**:
- Hand-drawn appearance with visible charcoal strokes
- Rich charcoal textures showing the artist's hand
- Layered tones: soft vine charcoal for mid-tones, compressed charcoal for deep blacks
- Smooth tonal transitions through blending with stumped/smudged areas
- Highlights added by lifting charcoal for dimension
- Emphasis on fur texture, facial details, soulful expression
- Hand-crafted feel with visible charcoal grain and texture
- Realistic depth and lifelike detail through value rendering
- **Strictly monochrome** - blacks, grays, whites only (NO COLOR)
- White or textured paper background

### Deployment
- **Revision**: gemini-artistic-api-00010-rvh
- **Service URL**: https://gemini-artistic-api-3km6z2qpyq-uc.a.run.app
- **Build Time**: 45 seconds
- **Status**: âœ… Deployed and verified

### Verification

```

### Impact
The Charcoal Realism style will now produce authentic hand-drawn charcoal portraits with:
- Visible charcoal strokes and texture
- Traditional charcoal drawing techniques (layering, blending, lifting)
- Strictly black and white monochrome output
- Realistic depth through value rendering
- Hand-crafted artistic appearance

This creates proper differentiation from Black & White Fine Art (dramatic photography) and Modern Ink & Wash (brush painting).

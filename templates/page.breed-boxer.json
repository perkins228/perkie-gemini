            "style_description": "Color captures the warm fawn tones, the brindle pattern, and the flash markings that make each boxer unique. This style preserves the eye color and subtle facial shading that give boxers their distinctive expressive quality. The most popular choice for boxer owners who want a portrait that looks exactly like their dog.",

            "style_description": "Black and white transforms a boxer's square, muscular face into something that belongs in a gallery. The strong jawline, the deep eyes, the underbite. These features create a portrait with real visual weight. Especially striking for flashy boxers, where the white markings create bold graphic contrast. A popular choice for boxer memorial portraits, where the dignified feel creates a lasting tribute.",

Vivid colors and defined strokes bring out the joy and enthusiasm that boxers radiate. Brindle boxers are particularly stunning in Marker, where the pattern becomes an eye-catching graphic element.",

A photo where the lower jaw is slightly visible (even subtly) adds character that a closed-mouth photo misses. Don't force it. Just catch a natural moment where that underbite peeks out."

            "tip_description": "Boxers are perpetual motion machines, but even they have moments of stillness. Right after exercise, during a quiet evening, or when they're watching something intently. These brief windows of calm produce the clearest, most detailed facial photos. A blurry mid-bounce photo won't give us enough detail."

            "tip_description": "Boxers' deep-set eyes and prominent brow can create heavy shadows in harsh lighting. Soft, diffused natural light fills in those shadows and reveals the full expression. Outdoor shade or window light on an overcast day works best."

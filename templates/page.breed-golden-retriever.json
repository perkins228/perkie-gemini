This style preserves the warm tones and subtle coat variations that make goldens so beautiful. The gradients from deep amber to light cream come through in full detail.

Their eyes, the texture of their fur, the structure of their face. Black and white portraits give goldens a fine art, studio-quality look that works especially well as large framed prints. This is also a popular choice for memorial portraits, where the classic, dignified feel of black and white creates a timeless tribute.",

4. **Gradual Rollout**: 10% → 50% → 100%
5. **Daily Monitoring**: First 7 days

---

## 16. The Counter-Argument

### Devil's Advocate Concerns
1. Share rates might be overstated
2. Desktop friction might persist
3. Could cannibalize purchases

1. Mobile data is real (22-25%)
2. Image availability is the blocker
3. A/B testing reveals truth quickly
4. Kill switch protects downside

---

## 17. Executive Decision

### VERDICT: BUILD

**The Bottom Line**:
You have a 70% functional viral engine that needs 1-2 days to reach 100%. The marginal investment ($2,500) offers 10x potential return. Mobile success validates the concept. Desktop fix is straightforward.

**Critical Insight**:
This isn't about social sharing—it's about building a zero-CAC customer acquisition engine at peak emotional engagement. The difference between K=0.23 and K=0.35 is the difference between linear and exponential growth.

**Opportunity Cost of NOT Building**:
- Lost revenue: $10,800-25,200/year
- Lost customers: 200-500/year
- Lost market position: Competitors will copy
- Lost brand impressions: 50,000+/year

**Required Action**:
Approve 1-2 developer days immediately to implement server-side image hosting. This transforms a broken feature into a growth engine.

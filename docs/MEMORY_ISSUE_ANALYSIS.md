# Memory Issue Analysis - GPU Cold Start Crashes

## Summary

The 503 and 500 errors are caused by memory exhaustion during multi-effect processing on cold starts. The recent frontend change from JPEG to PNG format is contributing to the problem by sending larger images to the API.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Frontend Changes (PNG vs JPEG)
- **Change**: Frontend now sends PNG format instead of JPEG to preserve transparency
- **Impact**: PNG files are typically 5-10x larger than JPEG
- **Example**: A 1MB JPEG becomes a 5-10MB PNG
- **Code Location**: `assets/ks-pet-bg-remover.js` line 661 - always generates PNG

### 2. Memory-Intensive Processing Pattern
The API processes all 5 effects sequentially but keeps them all in memory:

```python
# From integrated_processor.py lines 160-226
for i, effect_name in enumerate(effects):
    # Process effect
    effect_result = self.effects_processor.process_single_effect(...)
    
    # Convert and save to buffer (memory intensive)
    result_image = Image.fromarray(result_rgba, mode='RGBA')
    result_buffer = BytesIO()
    result_image.save(result_buffer, format='PNG')
    result_bytes = result_buffer.getvalue()
    
    results[effect_name] = result_bytes  # KEEPS ALL RESULTS IN MEMORY
    
    # Cleanup attempt but results dict still holds all data
    del effect_result, result_image, result_buffer
    gc.collect()
```

### 3. Memory Multiplication Effect
For a single image request with 5 effects:
- Original PNG image: 5MB
- Background removed image: 5MB (cached in memory)
- Effect 1 result: 5MB
- Effect 2 result: 5MB
- Effect 3 result: 5MB
- Effect 4 result: 5MB
- Effect 5 result: 5MB
- **Total**: ~30MB per request

With GPU model loaded (~2GB) and limited container memory, this quickly exhausts resources.

### 4. Mobile Image Optimization Limitations
While the API has mobile detection and optimization (lines 188-262 in api_v2_endpoints.py), it only triggers for images > 1MB. PNG images from the frontend are often larger due to transparency.

## Solutions (No Warm Instances Required)

### Solution 1: Sequential Processing with Immediate Storage (Recommended)
Modify the API to process and store each effect immediately, freeing memory between effects:

```python
# Instead of keeping all results in memory
for effect_name in effects:
    effect_result = process_effect(...)
    
    # Store immediately to cloud storage
    effect_key = f"{session_id}/{effect_name}.png"
    await storage_manager.upload_result(effect_key, effect_result)
    
    # Return URL instead of data
    results[effect_name] = storage_manager.get_url(effect_key)
    
    # Free memory immediately
    del effect_result
    gc.collect()
```

### Solution 2: Frontend Optimization - Send JPEG for Processing
Modify frontend to send JPEG for processing while keeping PNG for display:

```javascript
// In ks-pet-bg-remover.js
async processImageWithMultipleEffects(file) {
    // Convert to JPEG for API processing
    const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
    const img = new Image();
    // ... load image ...
    
    canvas.toBlob(async (blob) => {
        const formData = new FormData();
        formData.append('file', blob, 'image.jpg');
        // Send JPEG to API
    }, 'image/jpeg', 0.85);  // 85% quality
}
```

### Solution 3: Batch Processing with Memory Limits
Process effects in batches with memory checks:

```python
def process_effects_with_memory_limit(effects, image, max_memory_mb=100):
    results = {}
    current_batch = []
    current_memory = 0
    
    for effect in effects:
        estimated_memory = estimate_effect_memory(effect, image.size)
        
        if current_memory + estimated_memory > max_memory_mb:
            # Process current batch
            batch_results = process_batch(current_batch, image)
            results.update(batch_results)
            
            # Clear memory
            gc.collect()
            torch.cuda.empty_cache()
            
            # Start new batch
            current_batch = [effect]
            current_memory = estimated_memory
        else:
            current_batch.append(effect)
            current_memory += estimated_memory
    
    # Process final batch
    if current_batch:
        batch_results = process_batch(current_batch, image)
        results.update(batch_results)
    
    return results
```

### Solution 4: Aggressive Image Size Limits
Lower the threshold for image optimization:

```python
# In api_v2_endpoints.py, line 216
# Change from:
if is_mobile or original_size_mb > 1.0:

# To:
if is_mobile or original_size_mb > 0.5:  # More aggressive
    max_size = 1024 if is_mobile else 1536  # Smaller max sizes
```

### Solution 5: Stream Processing Response
Instead of returning all effects at once, stream them:

```python
async def stream_effects_processing(effects, image):
    async def generate():
        for effect in effects:
            # Process single effect
            result = await process_single_effect(effect, image)
            
            # Yield result
            yield {
                "effect": effect,
                "data": base64.encode(result)
            }
            
            # Free memory immediately
            del result
            gc.collect()
    
    return StreamingResponse(generate(), media_type="application/json")
```

## Immediate Actions

1. **Quick Fix**: Implement more aggressive image optimization (Solution 4)
2. **Medium Fix**: Modify frontend to send JPEG (Solution 2)
3. **Long-term Fix**: Implement sequential processing with storage (Solution 1)

## Memory Usage Comparison

| Scenario | Current Memory Usage | With Solutions |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Cold start, 5 effects, 2MB PNG | ~40MB spike | ~8MB steady |
| Warm start, 5 effects, 2MB PNG | ~30MB spike | ~6MB steady |
| Mobile 4MB PNG, 5 effects | ~80MB spike (crashes) | ~10MB steady |

## Monitoring Improvements

Add memory tracking to the API responses:

```python
# In health check endpoint
"memory_pressure": memory_monitor.check_memory_pressure(),
"memory_usage_mb": memory_info['cpu_memory_mb'],
"memory_available_mb": memory_info['available_memory_mb'],
"gpu_memory_percent": memory_info.get('gpu_memory_percent', 0)
```

## Cost-Effective Alternative to Warm Instances

Instead of keeping instances warm ($300/month), implement:

1. **Preemptive Scaling**: Monitor memory and spawn new instances before crashes
2. **Request Queuing**: Queue requests when memory is high
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Process fewer effects when under memory pressure
4. **CDN Caching**: Cache processed effects at CDN level to reduce reprocessing

These solutions will eliminate the memory crashes without the need for keeping expensive GPU instances warm.

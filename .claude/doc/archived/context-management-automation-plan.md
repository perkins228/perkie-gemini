# Context Management Automation Implementation Plan

*Created: 2025-08-29*
*Status: Strategic Recommendation*

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the current context management situation (60K→1K token reduction achieved manually), I recommend a **SEMI-AUTOMATED APPROACH** that balances efficiency with control for your fast-moving development team.

## Current Situation Analysis

### Facts
- Context file grew from 0 to 60,000 tokens in 3 days (~20K tokens/day)
- Manual compaction took ~10 minutes
- Multiple sub-agents append to same file
- Archive structure already established and working well
- Team is small and moving fast on a NEW BUILD

### Critical Constraints
- Rapid development pace requires historical context
- Multiple agents need concurrent access
- Claude's context window limitations
- Small team can't afford complex automation overhead

## Recommended Approach: SEMI-AUTOMATED with MANUAL TRIGGERS

### Why Semi-Automated?
1. **Control**: Manual review ensures critical context isn't lost during pivotal moments
2. **Flexibility**: Can delay archiving during critical debugging or decision phases
3. **Simplicity**: No complex automation to debug when you should be building features
4. **Learning**: Manual process helps team understand what's truly important to retain

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Monitoring & Alerts (Week 1)
Create a simple monitoring script that alerts when action is needed:

```python
# .claude/scripts/context-monitor.py
import os
import json
from datetime import datetime

class ContextMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.threshold_tokens = 40000  # Alert at 40K
        self.threshold_days = 3         # Alert every 3 days
        
    def check_context_health(self):
        """Returns status and recommendations"""
        # Check token count
        # Check last archive date
        # Return: {needs_archive: bool, reason: str, metrics: dict}
```

### Phase 2: Assisted Archiving Tool (Week 1-2)
Build a tool that helps but doesn't fully automate:

```python
# .claude/scripts/archive-assistant.py
class ArchiveAssistant:
    def suggest_archives(self):
        """Analyzes content and suggests what to archive"""
        # Group by topic/date
        # Identify completed work
        # Preserve active items
        # Generate archive plan for human review
        
    def execute_archive(self, plan):
        """Executes approved archive plan"""
        # Create topic-based archives
        # Update main context file
        # Maintain index
```

### Phase 3: Scheduled Checks (Week 2-3)
Add lightweight scheduled checks:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/context-health.yml
name: Context Health Check
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * *'  # Daily at 9am
  workflow_dispatch:     # Manual trigger

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check context size
      - name: Create issue if action needed
```

## Trigger Recommendations

### Primary Triggers (Manual)
1. **Token Count**: Archive when approaching 40,000 tokens
2. **Time-Based**: Review every 3 days minimum
3. **Milestone-Based**: Archive after major feature completion
4. **Pre-Decision**: Archive before major architectural decisions

### Automated Alerts (Not Actions)
- GitHub Action creates issue when threshold reached
- Slack/Discord notification to team
- Console warning in development environment

## Risk Analysis

### Automation Risks ❌
- **Loss of critical context** during active debugging
- **Over-complexity** for small team
- **False archiving** of active work items
- **Debugging automation** instead of building features

### Manual Risks ⚠️
- **Delayed archiving** → performance degradation
- **Inconsistent process** → varying archive quality
- **Team overhead** → 10 minutes every few days

### Semi-Automated Benefits ✅
- **Human judgment** on what's truly archivable
- **Flexible timing** around development cycles
- **Simple tooling** that assists, not replaces
- **Learning opportunity** about project patterns

## Optimal Context Size Recommendations

### Active Context File
- **Sweet Spot**: 5,000-10,000 tokens
- **Warning Zone**: 20,000-30,000 tokens
- **Critical**: >40,000 tokens

### Why These Numbers?
- 5-10K: Fast processing, covers recent week's work
- 20-30K: Still manageable but getting sluggish
- 40K+: Noticeable performance impact, harder to navigate

## Practical Implementation Steps

### Week 1: Immediate Actions
1. Set calendar reminder for 3-day reviews
2. Create simple token counter script
3. Document current archive process
4. Share with team for feedback

### Week 2: Build Assist Tools
1. Implement context-monitor.py
2. Create archive templates
3. Add pre-commit hook for size warning
4. Test with next natural archive cycle

### Week 3: Evaluate & Adjust
1. Review first two archive cycles
2. Adjust thresholds based on experience
3. Consider fuller automation only if justified
4. Document lessons learned

## Decision Framework

### When to Archive
```
IF (tokens > 40000) OR (days_since_archive > 3) OR (major_feature_complete)
  THEN → Review for archiving

IF (active_debugging) OR (critical_decision_pending) OR (multi-agent_coordination)
  THEN → Delay archiving 24 hours

IF (archived)
  THEN → Keep last 5000 tokens as overlap
```

### What to Keep Active
- Current sprint/week's work
- Open bugs and their investigation
- Pending decisions and context
- Configuration and settings
- Quick reference commands

### What to Archive
- Completed feature implementations
- Resolved bug investigations
- Historical decisions already acted upon
- Superseded approaches
- Detailed technical discussions

## Team Guidelines

### For Developers
1. **Mark completed items** with [ARCHIVED] tag when done
2. **Use clear headers** for easy sectioning
3. **Date your entries** for temporal context
4. **Flag critical items** that must not be archived

### For Agents
1. **Append concisely** - summaries over details
2. **Reference archives** when needed
3. **Flag long entries** for review
4. **Use structured format** for easy parsing

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Current Manual Process
- **Cost**: 10 minutes every 3 days = 100 minutes/month
- **Benefit**: Full control, learning, flexibility
- **ROI**: High - minimal time for maximum understanding

### Proposed Semi-Automated
- **Cost**: 8 hours setup + 5 minutes every 3 days
- **Benefit**: Alerts, assistance, consistency
- **ROI**: Positive after 2 months

### Full Automation
- **Cost**: 20+ hours setup + ongoing maintenance
- **Benefit**: Hands-off operation
- **ROI**: Negative for small team in rapid development

## Final Recommendation

**GO WITH SEMI-AUTOMATED APPROACH**

### Rationale
1. You're in rapid development - flexibility is crucial
2. Small team can handle 10 minutes every 3 days
3. Manual review builds institutional knowledge
4. Assists without over-engineering
5. Can evolve to full automation later if needed

### Success Metrics
- Context file stays under 20K tokens 90% of time
- Archive process takes <10 minutes
- No critical context lost in 30 days
- Team satisfaction with process

### Next Steps
1. Implement monitoring script (2 hours)
2. Create archive assistant (4 hours)  
3. Document process for team (1 hour)
4. Review after 2 weeks of use
5. Adjust based on team feedback

## Appendix: Quick Scripts

### Token Counter (Immediate Use)
```bash
# .claude/scripts/check-context.sh
#!/bin/bash
FILE=".claude/tasks/context_session_001.md"
TOKENS=$(wc -w < "$FILE")
LINES=$(wc -l < "$FILE")
echo "Context Status:"
echo "  Tokens: ~$TOKENS"
echo "  Lines: $LINES"
if [ $TOKENS -gt 40000 ]; then
    echo "  ⚠️ ARCHIVE RECOMMENDED"
fi
```

### Archive Preparation Helper
```python
# .claude/scripts/prep-archive.py
import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def identify_archivable_sections(file_path):
    """Suggests sections ready for archiving"""
    # Read file
    # Find completed sections (### headers with ✅)
    # Find old dated entries (>3 days)
    # Return suggested archive groups
    pass
```

This approach balances your need for speed with sustainable practices that will scale as your project grows.
